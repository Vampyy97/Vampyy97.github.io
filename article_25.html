Intuition', by Laura Huang</h2><p class="MsoNormal">YOU</p><p class="MsoNormal">ALREADY</p><p class="MsoNormal">KNOW</p><p class="MsoNormal">LAURA HUANG</p><p class="MsoNormal">When faced with a difficult<br/>
business decision, do you<br/>
already know what to do?<br/>
Laura Huang urges us to<br/>
pay attention to that<br/>
nagging feeling a hire<br/>
might not be quite right, or<br/>
a risky investment is the<br/>
next big thing. Core to her<br/>
approach is intentional<br/>
intuition: interrogating<br/>
uneasy feelings and<br/>
drawing on experience to<br/>
challenge why you feel<br/>
them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The book highlights<br/>
leaders who have followed<br/>
their instincts to success,<br/>
though some are less an<br/>
endorsement for going<br/>
with your gut, than for<br/>
treating your labour force<br/>
with respect and dignity.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The book meanders into<br/>
self-help territory in<br/>
places, including exercises<br/>
and a cover evoking<br/>
Eckhart Tolle's The Power<br/>
of Now.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ultimately, it serves as a<br/>
reminder to pay attention<br/>
to your emotions, and<br/>
avoid the grifters.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Â </p></body></html>
