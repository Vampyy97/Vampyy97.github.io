ascent, buoyed by investors’ faith in robust corporate balance sheets, surging
earnings and a vision of future productivity gains.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This exuberance has been underpinned by a US economy that
has proved remarkably resilient. Yet, with most traditional valuation
indicators now flashing amber, the path forward hinges on a delicate interplay
of economic and financial influences.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This week, Wall Street’s S&amp;P 500 closed at another
record high — its 15th of the year — in a climb that has included the fastest
recovery from a market correction of more than 15 per cent, according to
Goldman Sachs. While an important share of this gain has been attributed to a
handful of familiar tech groups, the broader market has also registered
respectable returns.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Much of the capital flowing into Wall Street stocks reflects
a renewed bet on US economic exceptionalism, albeit with a narrowed focus in
favour of corporate America and away from the sovereign. Many market watchers
might have doubts about the sustainability of such a decoupling but it has
allowed the US stock market to flourish.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Investors are comfortable with the notion that an
exceptional trifecta for tech groups in particular — solid earnings, easy
access to funding and promising innovations — will shield valuations from more
negative forces. The latter includes the weaponisation of tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Market valuations have reached levels that usually warrant
caution. No single valuation metric provides a reliable picture. However, there
is a breadth of indicators signalling caution currently.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The cyclically adjusted S&amp;P 500’s Shiller CAPE Ratio
currently hovers just under 40, more than twice its long-term average and
approaching the dotcom bubble’s peak of 44. The narrower forward
price-to-earnings ratio stands at 22, notably above its long-term average, as
does the price-to-sales ratio. Warren Buffett’s favoured indicator — total
market capitalisation to GDP — is at an all-time high and the US dividend yield
has slid to almost 1 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Those who dismiss such cautionary signals typically lean on
two arguments. The first is captured by the market adage “the trend is your
friend.” Advocates argue investors should continue a “high-risk” approach until
there is compelling evidence of the wave breaking.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The second argument runs deeper, anchored in techno-optimism
or what Nouriel Roubini termed “tech trumps all” — well-funded and dynamic tech
companies will legitimately drive markets to ever-higher valuations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">All this stands in contrast to the wider economy where an
anxious “wait and see” attitude prevails. Data suggests some reversion to
dispersion trends evident in earlier years — a K-shaped economy where the
wealthy accumulate more but low-income households struggle; growth in services
versus pressure on manufacturing; and notably more favourable funding prospects
for large companies relative to small businesses.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Crucially, this is not about a new wave of more exciting
discoveries, although these are highly probable, especially in artificial
intelligence, life sciences, robotics and eventually quantum computing. Rather
it is about gains in productivity and growth from the broad diffusion of
already introduced technology.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Against this, there are the negative forces. The first being
mounting concerns about excessive public debt in many advanced economies. This
risks triggering notably higher interest rates and a steeper rise in bond
yields from short-term debt to longer-maturity paper. Such a scenario would
squeeze corporate profitability, strain household budgets and complicate
government finances.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The second potential negative force is the risk that the
emerging global tariff regime disintegrates into a trade war rather than
stabilising after recent deals. This could mean widespread retaliatory measures
that stifle economic activity and further disrupt global supply chains.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Like many, I hope that the broad and inclusive diffusion of
innovations will prevail with the rise of AI benefiting every citizen. However,
this is far from a sure bet amid such unusual policy-induced volatility.</p><p class="MsoNormal">— Mohamed El-Erian is president of Queens’ College,
