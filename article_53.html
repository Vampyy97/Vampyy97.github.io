importance</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Christian Davies and Song Jung-a — Seoul</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">Samsung Electronics has won a $16.5bn order to produce
Tesla’s next generation of custom artificial intelligence chips, raising hopes
of a turnaround in the South Korean tech giant’s struggling contract chipmaking
business.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The eight-year contract, announced by Samsung in a
regulatory filing and confirmed by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk yesterday,
is the biggest deal Samsung’s chip business has won from a single customer. Its
value is equivalent to 7.6 per cent of the company’s 2024 revenue. Samsung
shares rose 6 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Musk wrote on his social media platform X that Samsung would
produce Tesla’s next-generation AI6 chip at its new manufacturing facility in
Texas, part of a $40bn investment made by the South Korean company with
assistance from subsidies under former US president Joe Biden’s Chips and
Science Act.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The custom chip will be used to power Tesla’s autonomous
driving and humanoid technologies. Musk noted during an earnings call last week
that he hoped the AI6 chip could also be used in data centres to power Tesla’s
AI model training programmes. That would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on
general-purpose graphics processing units produced by companies such as Nvidia
and AMD.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Musk said Samsung had "agreed to allow Tesla to assist
in maximising manufacturing efficiency" and that he would "walk the
line personally to accelerate the pace of progress."</p><p class="MsoNormal">"The fab is conveniently located not far from my
house," added Musk, who also said "the strategic importance of this
is hard to overstate." He later posted that the $16.5bn figure was
"just the bare minimum." "Actual output is likely to be several
times higher," he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The announcement marks a victory for Samsung as it struggles
to gain foundry market share from global leader Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., Tesla’s contract chip partner for the AI5 chip, which is
expected to enter mass production later this year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Samsung this year had delayed until 2026 the start of
operations in its 2-nanometre chip plant in Taylor, Texas, as it struggled to
persuade large customers to switch from TSMC, which has also built
manufacturing facilities in the US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Macquarie analysts warned last September that Samsung’s
$17bn facility could end up as a "big stranded asset" owing to a lack
of big clients, while the South Korean technology group’s contract chipmaking
business is estimated to have suffered a Won4tn ($3bn) operating loss in the
first half of this year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Samsung, which will report full second-quarter earnings on
Thursday, this month projected a 56 per cent drop in second-quarter operating
profit compared with the same quarter last year, amid US restrictions on China
and its failure to pass stringent performance tests to supply key customer
Nvidia with advanced memory products.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kim Yang-paeng, a researcher at Korea Institute of
Industrial Economics and Trade, said the Tesla deal would help Samsung’s
foundry in Texas to improve its yields — the share of usable chips produced —
and broaden its customer base.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Winning a big order from a global company can prompt
other Big Tech companies to consider Samsung as an alternative to TSMC,"
he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>See Lex</i></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
