crisis starts (Spectrum, Life &amp; Arts, June 28) serves as a sobering
reminder of the role insurance could play in a financial crisis caused by
climate shocks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It’s important to note, however, that our industry is not
powerless in the face of a system meltdown. Insurers must work with
policymakers, businesses and communities to move beyond the present focus on
the short term. We have the insights and tools right now to avoid a
catastrophic collapse. What’s missing is the will to use them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Take flooding. The loss history at our company, FM, shows
that facilities with well-organised flood emergency response plans experience
nearly 70 per cent less damage than those without them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Bringing these together with community-based plans can bring
broader and more impactful resilience.</p><p class="MsoNormal">These and other fairly simple measures won’t reverse the
general trend of increasing risk. They can, however, be done now as an initial
step on the way to long-term resilience. And they are far superior to waiting
for climate shocks to leave us with no choice.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Louis Gritzo<br/>
