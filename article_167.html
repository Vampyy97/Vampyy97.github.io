weight-loss drug race</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="605" src="FT_files/image080.jpg" width="601"/></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="476" src="FT_files/image081.png" width="558"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">Until a year ago, Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk was riding
high. It had been first to market with an injectable diabetes treatment and the
name Ozempic quickly became shorthand for a new class of blockbuster
weight-loss drugs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But competition started to catch up, a new drug trial
disappointed, shares and growth fell, and its chief executive departed in May.
Then on Tuesday a major profit warning knocked more than €60bn off its value.
The company also announced that senior executive Maziar Mike Doustdar would
become the new CEO.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some in the industry say Novo’s core problem is quite
simple: US rival Eli Lilly came up with a better product. Trials found more
weight loss from Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound than Ozempic and another Novo
drug, Wegovy, and anecdotally doctors report fewer side effects.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“You can’t magically change the product profile,” said
Gareth Powell, a healthcare fund manager at Polar Capital, an investor in both
groups.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ultimately, many shareholders and analysts now see this as
Lilly’s market to lose. Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel’s global
healthcare group, said Lilly had worked at “double speed” to commercialise its
drugs. “Lilly just outgunned Novo,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Doustdar argued on Tuesday that there were still big
opportunities for Novo in the weight-loss market and that the company had the
pipeline of drugs to capitalise on them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“This is a market with more than 1bn patients and a huge
unmet need,” he said. “I think we are very well positioned with our
manufacturing capabilities, with our science, with our commercial activities
and with brand recognition.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The turmoil at Novo comes after some huge successes for the
company — at its peak last June, its shares were up almost 300 per cent in
three years as demand for weight-loss drugs soared.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But, ahead of this week’s profit warning, there had been
worrying signs from US prescription data. Novo was the first to win US
regulatory approval for its new diabetes and weight-loss treatments: Ozempic
was approved for diabetes in 2017 and Wegovy for obesity in 2021.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But having had the lead in market share since then,
prescription data from July showed Ozempic slipping below 50 per cent for the
first time. According to research firm Iqvia, prescriptions for Lilly’s
Mounjaro were at more than 622,000 a week, compared with 607,000 for Ozempic,
while Zepbound had already overtaken Wegovy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Emily Field, an analyst at Barclays, said Novo’s share price
decline over the past year had been like a “slow-moving car crash” as it lost
ground to Lilly, both in sales of existing obesity drugs and in drugs under
development. Novo’s shares are now down 60 per cent in the past year, compared
with a 6 per cent fall for Lilly.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some say that previous CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen has
been unfairly blamed for not keeping the share price at what one person close
to Novo called “ridiculous heights.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“They’ve been an incredibly successful company. The previous
CEO did amazing things. For all the criticism that the stock price has fallen,
it had gone up a lot,” Powell said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">He added that the sheer number of obese and overweight
people was a positive. “The market is still tiny in terms of penetration. So,
you know, still in theory it is a huge... opportunity.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">For others, Novo made mis-steps before it had even launched
the drugs, failing to prepare for demand. Then it did not change tack quickly
enough in the US when it became clear people were happy to bypass insurance and
pay for weight-loss drugs themselves.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Novo initially struggled to meet much higher than expected
demand. Evan Seigerman, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said it based its
sales forecasts partly on its earlier drug, Saxenda, which is not as effective
for weight loss.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But the person close to Novo said that although with
hindsight it was a huge market, “it would have been crazy to anticipate” the
early surge in demand, and Novo had to be wary of producing a surplus that
would go beyond its expiry date and so be unsellable. They added that Novo had
since boosted production by acquiring factories from contract manufacturer
Catalent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However, some analysts say this early miscalculation has had
a longer-lasting effect. When doctors and patients had trouble getting hold of
Novo’s drugs, they switched to Lilly or to replicas that were widely available
at the time, and did not switch back. Lilly also had some early supply problems
but they were resolved more quickly.</p><p class="MsoNormal">At the same time, Novo launched in other markets while still
trying to increase supply in the US. Seigerman said multi-country launches
tended to be the company’s modus operandi. “They will supply and provide supply
to their markets, even though that may be less profitable,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Then there was marketing. Novo seemed to struggle at first
to make the transition from a business largely focused on selling insulin
products — using research to convince clinicians — to the highly consumer and
celebrity-centric market for weight-loss drugs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“It was completely unknown territory,” another person close
to the company said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Field said people were “very sceptical” about Novo’s
commercial strategy, compared with Lilly’s “much more aggressive” approach.
“People think Novo was too complacent in its launch strategy, betting on the
strength of the drug’s profile rather than being more proactive to get it in
patient hands.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lilly recognised the different market dynamic more quickly,
and launched LillyDirect at the start of 2024 to sell drugs directly to
patients at cheaper prices. Novo did not follow suit until March this year,
when it started a similar service called NovoCare. The Danish group has also
signed an exclusive deal with US pharmacy benefit manager CVS Caremark, which
recently made Wegovy its preferred obesity drug.</p><p class="MsoNormal">US-based Lilly may have made different decisions because of
a “cultural advantage,” said Seigerman. “Lilly had the understanding to read
the room... when it comes to the nuances of the United States and the evolving
healthcare market,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Investors are already looking ahead to the next generation
of obesity treatments, where they believe Lilly also has an upper hand.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Novo shares fell sharply in December on disappointing
results for its new injectable weight-loss drug CagriSema. Analysts complained
that the company had been overconfident in guiding on 25 per cent average
weight loss, without warning that patients could control their own dose.
Results showed that trial participants lost an average of 23 per cent of their
body weight. For Wegovy, the average is 16 per cent and for Lilly’s Mounjaro,
it is 21 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Powell said while investors had been critical of the miss on
target weight loss, CagriSema could still have a “surprisingly good launch” if
doctors see it as effective.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, he added that Novo needed to accelerate the
development of its pipeline or make acquisitions. Most of the weight-loss drugs
it has acquired are unlikely to come to market before the end of the decade.</p><p class="MsoNormal">He said it would need to move even faster if Lilly’s obesity
pill orforglipron, which could be launched next year, had a good side-effect
profile. “If that looks OK, I think it has the potential for a very fast
launch. It could eat into the injectables market, which will be obviously an
additional pressure point for Novo,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Novo has submitted an oral version of semaglutide, the
active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, to regulators. But Field worries that
although it is a pill, patients will have to be careful about taking it: it
cannot be taken with food, drink or other medicines.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Field added that Novo had made a “really big bet” on
CagriSema, while Lilly had spread its bets more widely. While Lilly is Novo’s
major threat for now, both companies face competition as other drugmakers, such
as Roche and AstraZeneca, develop rival drugs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">One person close to Novo said there was a recognition that
it needs to become more consumer-focused and show “enthusiasm” about finding
the right strategy. “They are talking about, ‘how do we turn this big ship
around?’”</p><p class="MsoNormal">This week’s profit warning and the market response reinforce
the urgency of the task facing Doustdar. Asked about the ailing share price, he
gave a blunt response. “My message is I don’t like it: I don't like it as an
employee, I don't like it as a CEO elect — and I certainly don’t like it as a
shareholder myself,” he said. “But setbacks don’t define companies. Our
response does.”</p></body></html>
