<p class=MsoNormal><b>Brussels accepts 15% US tariffs to fix ‘unfair trade
relations’, says Trump</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=574 height=391 src="FT_files/image001.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>• EU to buy more US arms and energy • Accord with von der
Leyen • Transatlantic strife averted</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HENRY FOY — TURNBERRY<br>
AIME WILLIAMS — WASHINGTON<br>
ANDY BOUNDS — BRUSSELS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The US and EU have struck a trade deal that will impose 15
per cent tariffs on EU products, Donald Trump said yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU has agreed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars
on additional American energy products and weapons as part of the deal, the US
president said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The agreement, which is set to avoid a transatlantic trade
war, was struck during a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von
der Leyen at Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The meeting, which lasted around an hour, saw the sides
agree a deal that was largely hashed out by negotiators earlier last week and
met the EU’s key benchmark of a blanket 15 per cent tariff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Earlier in the day Trump said he wanted to end the bloc’s
“unfair” trade relationship with the US. “We should give it a shot,” Trump said
ahead of the negotiations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sitting next to von der Leyen, Trump said the US-EU trade
relationship was “unfair to the United States … a one-sided relationship”. He
added: “Both sides want fairness.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After reaching the deal, he said that “this is probably the
biggest deal ever reached in any capacity, trade or beyond trade”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump said the EU would spend an additional $750bn on US
energy products, invest $600bn in the US and buy “a vast amount” in US military
equipment worth “hundreds of billions of dollars”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The US president said the US would put tariffs of 15 per
cent on EU goods, including automobiles, in exchange for the bloc “opening up
their countries at zero tariff”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking after the US president, von der Leyen said the new
tariff rate would be “all inclusive”, and described the arrangement as a “good
deal” that had been “tough” to reach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before the meeting von der Leyen said that the EU’s trade
surplus in goods with the US, which hit almost €200bn last year, needed to be
cut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We have to rebalance it,” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The deal is a major victory for Trump, who has spent months
forcing America’s allies into bruising negotiations by threatening steep
tariffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But US trading partners have expressed concern that, even
when they strike agreements with Trump to lower his tariffs, they face
uncertainty over future levies on sectors including pharmaceuticals, chips and
aerospace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EU steel and aluminium imports are exempted from the deal.
Trump said the levies, which he has set at 50 per cent for most countries
across the world, would not be tackled until after an initial agreement with
the EU, dashing the industries’ hopes for an early and low tariff quota.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump had threatened to impose 30 per cent tariffs on EU
products imported into the US if no deal was finalised by August 1, a move that
would almost certainly have sparked retaliation by the bloc and a transatlantic
trade war.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU had prepared a retaliatory package of tariffs of up
to 30 per cent against €92bn of US exports if it could not reach an agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking after the deal was announced, US commerce secretary
Howard Lutnick said the US would unveil new tariffs on chips as a result of its
national security probe into the sector in two weeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>VPN group sees demand rise 1,800% as Britons seek to
evade online safety law</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TIM BRADSHAW — LONDON</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>British internet users have rushed to access services that
disguise a user’s online location after new age verification rules came into
force.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thousands of sites offering adult content, as well as
popular social media apps including X, Reddit and TikTok, have introduced “age
assurance” controls for UK users since Friday to comply with the Online Safety
Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The age checks are designed to prevent children under 18
from accessing sites that carry pornography as well as other harmful material
that relates to self-harm, eating disorders or suicide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But to evade the new rules, a growing number of people are
turning to tools more often used by citizens in authoritarian regimes to get
around internet censorship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Apps offering virtual private networks — which route a
smartphone or PC’s internet traffic through another country, bypassing local
network providers — made up half of the top 10 most popular free apps on the
UK’s App Store for iOS this weekend, according to Apple’s rankings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Proton VPN leapfrogged ChatGPT to become the top free app in
the UK, according to Apple’s daily App Store charts, with similar services from
developers Super Unlimited and Nord Security also rising over the weekend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Proton said it had experienced a more than 1,800 per cent
increase in daily sign-ups from UK-based users. Nord said there had been a
1,000 per cent increase in UK purchases of VPN subscriptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We would normally associate these large spikes in sign-ups
with major civil unrest,” Proton said. “This clearly shows that adults are
concerned about the impact universal age verification laws will have on their
privacy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The UK is one of the first democratic countries to impose
such strict content controls on tech companies, making it a test case that will
be monitored around the world. Several US states and Australia have also sought
to impose age-based restrictions for online services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Platforms in breach of the rules face penalties of up to
£18mn or 10 per cent of global turnover, whichever is greater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Act — which was passed under the previous Conservative
government in 2023 — has also become a potential flashpoint with the US. Trump
administration officials oppose anything they see as a restriction on freedom
of speech.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Israel opens Gaza aid corridors after uproar</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NERI ZILBER — TEL AVIV<br>
HEBA SALEH — CAIRO</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israel said it had started daily “tactical pauses” to
military activity in Gaza and would create “humanitarian corridors” throughout
the strip, an apparent reversal of its policy after months of severe aid
restrictions pushed the enclave to the brink of famine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shift was approved by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu’s government and announced by the Israel Defense Forces amid growing
international condemnation of what UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on
Saturday called the “appalling” humanitarian conditions inside Gaza.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The IDF said the halts to military activity, which began
yesterday, would happen daily from 10am to 8pm in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah and
the Al-Mawasi coastal area, places to which the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.1mn
people have been forcibly displaced and where Israeli ground troops are not
present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, the IDF said the humanitarian corridors would
be in place from 6am to 11pm every day to enable the “safe passage” of aid
convoys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tom Fletcher, the UN relief chief, welcomed the announcement
and said UN teams on the ground “will do all we can to reach as many starving
people as we can in this window”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The World Food Programme also welcomed Israel’s decision to
facilitate access to aid and said it had “enough food in or on its way to the
region to feed the entire population ... for almost three months”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Egyptian Red Crescent said yesterday that it had sent
more than 100 trucks into Gaza carrying more than 1,200 tonnes of flour and 450
tonnes of food packages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, one UN official said they were unclear on how long
the humanitarian corridors would be in place, while another said aid agencies
were in contact with the Israeli military for clarity on details of the new
arrangement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Netanyahu, speaking at an air force base yesterday, said
Israel was allowing the entry of “minimal humanitarian supplies”, as it has
done “up until now”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The UN is creating excuses and lies against the state of
Israel,” he said. “There will be no more excuses. We will continue to act until
we achieve all of our war goals — until total victory.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Israeli air force began parachuting humanitarian
supplies into Gaza on Saturday night, while Jordan and the United Arab Emirates
also airdropped supplies into the enclave yesterday. UK officials said they
were sending additional military planners to Jordan to help co-ordinate the
airdrops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foreign air forces, including those of the UK, France,
Jordan and the UAE, have previously conducted airdrops over Gaza during the
conflict. But humanitarian organisations have criticised them as an inadequate
means of meeting the territory's needs, with one UN official describing them as
a “distraction and a smokescreen”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David Lammy, the UK’s foreign secretary, said that while the
IDF’s announcement was “essential”, it “cannot alleviate the needs of those
desperately suffering in Gaza”. “We need a ceasefire that can end the war, for
hostages to be released and aid to enter Gaza by land unhindered,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Syria and jet deal test Trump and Erdogan bond</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=431 src="FT_files/image002.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JOHN PAUL RATHBONE — ISTANBUL</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was the body language of an established bromance:
Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US President Donald Trump shook
hands, smiled, then clinched each other at a group photo for the Nato summit in
The Hague last month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “extraordinary” relationship of these two “friends”, as
the pair call each other, has so far delivered a string of mutual wins. Turkey
has secured a better position than many US allies on tariffs. Washington has
lifted sanctions on Syria, as Erdogan wanted. Trump has also turned a blind eye
to Erdogan’s crackdown on the opposition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Erdogan has, meanwhile, provided his fellow Nato ally with a
venue for diplomatic talks with Russia, and the possibility of a US military
exit from Syria, which Trump has long wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, however, their relationship faces two significant
tests. The most urgent involves reconciling Turkey’s support for the government
of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa with destabilising Israeli military actions
in the Arab state. The second is to secure the end of US sanctions on Turkey’s
defence sector to allow a multibillion-dollar F-35 fighter jet deal that
Erdogan has long wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You can’t underestimate their chemistry,” Soner Cagaptay,
director of the Turkey research programme at The Washington Institute
think-tank, said of the two presidents. “Trump likes strong countries and
powerful leaders — Erdogan delivers both.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even so, “for all the talk of their bromance, Trump and
Erdogan don’t actually seem to get any deals done,” said Aaron Stein, president
of the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Washington.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nowhere has the “new era in Turkish-American relations” — as
Erdogan has described it — been more evident than in Syria. Turkey’s neighbour
had long been a source of tension because of clashing US and Turkish priorities
— particularly over US support for Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers an
extension of the militant group PKK.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But now Washington appears to all but repeat Turkish talking
points — even when they run counter to Israel’s, which has taken a hostile
stance towards Sharaa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In June, after speaking with Erdogan, Trump used his
executive powers to lift economic sanctions on Syria, a key Turkish ask. Then
the US this month moved to delist as a terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,
the Syrian president’s former movement — making HTS perhaps the first terror
organisation ever to be delisted by the US before it became defunct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This was a big deal for Turkey. It was also a sign of
Trump’s faith in Erdogan,” Cagaptay said. “If Syria is stable, more of the over
3mn Syrian refugees living in Turkey will go back. That in turn helps with
nationalist issues inside Turkey and is a potential vote winner for Erdogan.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tom Barrack, one of Trump’s friends and the new US
ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, is a crucial go-between. Trump
has tasked Barrack — a smooth talking but tough private equity billionaire of
Lebanese descent — with elevating the bilateral relationship from “great” to
“extraordinary”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Barrack criticised Israel for creating “another very
confusing chapter” after it launched dozens of air strikes in Syria during a
wave of deadly sectarian clashes this month, saying it was acting to protect
the Druze religious minority. This rare public censure of Israel from a US
official appeared to provoke a tacit rebuttal from Israel’s defence minister
Israel Katz: “Those who criticise the attacks are not well versed in the
facts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second big test of the Trump-Erdogan relationship is
Turkey’s long-held desire to buy dozens of F-35 stealth fighter jets — a deal
that Erdogan sounded positive about after meeting Trump at The Hague, saying:
“Inshallah, we shall make progress.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the obstacles are formidable. The deal was blocked in
2020 under so-called CAATSA sanctions after Erdogan bought two Russian S-400
air defence batteries. Turkish officials have alluded to the S-400s remaining
stored in unopened crates ever since. But “if used, it would be like Russia
plugging a USB stick into Nato’s computer system,” one western official said.
“That is totally unacceptable for us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Barrack has suggested that a solution, including the
congressional approval required to lift the sanctions, might be found by the
end of this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the meantime, Turkey is seeking to recapitalise its
ageing air fleet by buying Eurofighter jets. Britain and Turkey signed a
preliminary multibillion-pound deal for the sale of Typhoon jets to Ankara last
week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the F-35s, “the successful formula will require both
sides to agree to some concessions to their doctrinal positions,” said Sinan
Ulgen, director of EDAM, an Istanbul think-tank. “Turkey will in essence have
to commit to never using the S-400 in practice — with monitoring to assuage the
trust deficit … But the US will have to show flexibility too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The stakes are high. If the issue is resolved, Lockheed
Martin could get a multibillion-dollar sales order. Turkish companies could
also get reinserted into the F-35 programme, regaining lucrative contracts that
once included building F-35 fuselages and serving as one of the jet’s main
maintenance hubs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s going to be a long haul,” cautioned Stein. “To buy the
F-35s, Turkey will need military financing — which requires congressional
approval. But Turkey is not popular in Congress, and the Greeks and Israeli
lobby will oppose the deal.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Analysts argue that where there is a will there is a way,
and expect that the F-35 deal will get done one day — even if that requires a
Trump executive order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harder to resolve are the growing tensions between Turkey
and Israel. Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said last week Ankara might
intervene if there were further attempts to divide Syria — a prospect that
raises the alarming possibility of clashes between the region’s two most
powerful militaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is Iran. Turkey bit its tongue when the US bombed
Iran’s nuclear facilities in June, issuing only a mild rebuke. But Ankara could
fall out completely with the US if there were to be a second round of the
Israel-Iran war that dealt more blows to Tehran and which led to a huge influx
of Iranian refugees into neighbouring Turkey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Berlin to avoid EU punishment for breaching budget rules</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PAOLA TAMMA — BRUSSELS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Germany will escape punishment for breaching strict EU
budget rules, thanks to an exemption that applies to its increase in defence
spending, Brussels’ top economic official has said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Europe's largest economy is forecast to record an excess
deficit of 3.3 per cent in 2025, but this is fully accounted for by an increase
in defence spending, EU economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told the
Financial Times. Berlin, therefore, “is likely not to end up in [the] excessive
deficit procedure,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU rules — which Germany helped design — dictate that
member states must keep their budget deficit within 3 per cent of GDP and
public debt below 60 per cent of GDP. A country could face fines if it does not
take corrective measures to meet the rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A final assessment of Germany’s position will take place
next spring when full data for 2025 is available, Dombrovskis said, adding: “We
have to see the execution, because it’s close, [but] if everything holds, then
it should not be the case for this year’s budget.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Berlin’s narrow escape signals a willingness from Brussels
to allow the bloc’s largest economy to spend lavishly at a time of higher
defence needs and low growth. Germany plans to exceed a 3 per cent annual
deficit threshold this year to the end of 2027, according to its own fiscal
plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the “national escape clause,” invoked by Germany and 15
other EU countries, allows member states to spend up to 1.5 per cent of their
output on defence over four years without breaking the rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clause was added at Germany's behest this year to
accommodate higher defence spending, given US demands on EU countries to boost
their own security and a new Nato target to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence
by 2035.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The request was a stark about-face from Germany, which
during a recent reform of fiscal rules asked for strict safeguards for
countries that breached EU debt and deficit thresholds. In negotiations over
the past few months with Berlin over its fiscal plan, Brussels granted Germany
a right to “backload” measures to reduce its budget deficit towards the later
years of its plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brussels has also accepted Germany’s estimate for the
potential growth impact of Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s €500bn infrastructure
investment fund and increased defence spending at 0.9 per cent on average until
2041 — up from 0.3 per cent in 2025 — something German officials stress is
allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brussels’ leniency towards Berlin is due to its relatively
low debt levels, projected to come in only slightly above the EU's 60 per cent
threshold at 63.8 per cent of GDP this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The commission has been quite lax in its interpretation of
the fiscal rules towards Germany,” said Guntram Wolff, a senior fellow at
think-tank Bruegel and a professor of economics at the Free University of
Brussels. “At some level, that is understandable given that debt levels are low
and also the deficit levels are small compared to France. At another level, it
is weakening the just reformed fiscal rules.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Procurement chief vows to continue supplier price squeeze</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=368 height=306 src="FT_files/image003.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JOE MILLER — WASHINGTON<br>
STEPHEN MORRIS — SAN FRANCISCO<br>
STEPHEN FOLEY — NEW YORK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Trump administration’s procurement chief has vowed to
persist with a Doge-inspired pricing squeeze on technology groups and
government suppliers, after some of the US’s largest corporations complained to
the White House about his aggressive approach to cost-cutting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Josh Gruenbaum, a former investment banker and director at
KKR who runs the powerful Federal Acquisition Service, has overseen a
months-long review of multibillion-dollar deals with software providers and
consultancies, convincing companies including Booz Allen Hamilton, Google and
Oracle to offer steep discounts on services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Gruenbaum’s sometimes brusque approach — demanding that
the likes of Microsoft, Amazon and Uber identify savings or face the possible
cancellation of lucrative contracts — has sent shockwaves through the tech and
consultancy industries. A letter from Gruenbaum sent to 10 leading consulting
firms in March demanding they justify each individual government contract read:
“A 15-year-old should be able to understand what service you provide and why it
is important — no consultative jargon or gobbledegook.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At least one chief executive complained directly to the
White House over the approach, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One leading US tech group said dealing with the
administration was impossible, and described it as a “circus”. “They are super
aggressive and have upset CEOs and others,” another government contractor told
the Financial Times. They added that airline industry executives were the
latest to complain about the FAS after learning their sector was the next to be
targeted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a recent interview with the FT, Gruenbaum claimed all
negotiations had taken place in good faith. “I can’t think of a single
contentious or caustic discussion I've had with industry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The General Services Administration, which houses the FAS,
claims the procurement review has resulted in more than $52bn in savings, of
which about $12bn comes from consulting contracts. The total figure accounts
for more than a quarter of the purported savings by the so-called Department of
Government Efficiency, or Doge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gruenbaum insisted his team’s approach was “going to persist
for the duration of this administration”. He added that multibillion-dollar
deals were still being reviewed against cheaper options.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We have shrewd business folks around us, we do run market
comparisons,” said Gruenbaum, whose role became more prominent after an
executive order further centralising procurement. “We have typically other
vendors who are like, ‘we could create proper market tension.’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He warned companies that “volume’s going to start shifting”
if government suppliers failed to offer value for money on existing contracts,
“and I think industry understands that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gruenbaum denied the White House was pressing him to go easy
on companies with close ties to the administration, such as Larry Ellison’s
Oracle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The buy-in from … the administration, for us to go and
execute on these things, that’s what’s making this happen,” he told the FT.
“We're not here to, like, just knuckle-drag people,” he said. “There’s a way to
get to a great deal where it’s a win-win, where you recognise ... how important
of a customer the federal government is.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The White House did not respond to a request for comment on
the complaints by chief executives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a subsequent statement, Gruenbaum defended his team’s
approach, saying: “We are tough, but fair, and we take our jobs safeguarding
American taxpayer money extremely seriously — we make no apologies for that. We
stand by our record of success.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Fox-style media site accused of stoking culture war in
Germany</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=320 src="FT_files/image004.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LAURA PITEL — BERLIN</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Leading a tour around the Berlin offices of his rightwing
online media outlet NIUS, editor-in-chief Julian Reichelt says that someone
once claimed that the old brick building used to house a toilet factory. It is,
he laughs, an easy metaphor for his critics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt, a former editor of powerful tabloid Bild who fell
from grace, is accused of stoking tensions over a top judge’s appointment, a
controversy that has plunged the ruling coalition into crisis and raised fears
that Germany is descending into US-style culture wars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now he is the face of an outlet that models itself on the
“frontal, very tough opinion format” of Rupert Murdoch's Fox News. NIUS was one
of the most active “alternative” rightwing sites that ran a deluge of negative
coverage about one of three constitutional court nominees, eventually prompting
the government to cancel a vote on the appointment this month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt seems unsure whether he wants to dispute the idea
of his influence on the vote or be proud of it. “I think it’s predictable and
ridiculous,” he said of the notion that the decision was swung by an online
campaign. “I think it’s what the left in this culture war always claims as soon
as they’re losing.” But he added: “I am more than willing to take the credit
for shaping the debate. And I am very proud of that. I love it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Founded two years ago with a yellow-orange logo and the
slogan “the voice of the majority”, NIUS today has just 43 staff and fewer than
6,000 paying subscribers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is still lossmaking — but is bankrolled by conservative
businessman Frank Gotthardt, who is also a donor to Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s
Christian Democrats (CDU).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Its YouTube viewing figures suggest that it reaches around
250,000 people a day with its flagship two-hour morning live show, which
features negative stories about asylum seekers, questions science on climate
change and rallies against “woke” culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Critics say there is a kind of symbiotic relationship with
the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), with the site echoing the party's
talking points and party officials sharing NIUS content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt says he doesn't “give a fuck” about who retweets
him and that he was not collaborating with the AfD, saying: “I've never
collaborated with any politician in my life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The site depicted constitutional court nominee Frauke
Brosius-Gersdorf as a “radical feminist” who advocated for abortion up until
the final weeks of pregnancy — a claim she has denied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Growing unease within the ruling CDU led to a backlash
against her nomination even though it had already been agreed behind the scenes
with their Social Democrat coalition partners, eventually causing a vote in the
Bundestag to be cancelled. Merz later hit out at the “unacceptable” campaign
against her, which he said amounted to “massive personal defamation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An analysis by the political consultancy Polisphere found
that NIUS published 20 negative stories about Brosius-Gersdorf in the nine days
before the failed vote, homing in on the sensitive subject of abortion, which
is illegal in Germany but in practice decriminalised up to the 12th week of
pregnancy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There were false allegations and slander — and other media
joined in,” said Philipp Salhoff, the company’s managing director. “The new and
interesting thing about this campaign was that it was so successful.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That assessment is not universally shared. Andreas Rodder, a
historian and a conservative standard bearer for Merz’s CDU, said it was too
simple to attribute the fiasco to the online media, adding that a “very broad
and diverse” coalition emerged against Brosius-Gersdorf’s nomination within the
CDU and its Bavarian sister party the CSU.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But one official from the Catholic Church told the Financial
Times that some senior clergy felt chastened after consuming and sharing claims
about the law professor that they later realised misrepresented her views. “We
have to think more carefully in future about our words and how they can be
instrumentalised,” the official said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt says that he is “pro-choice” on abortion and
generally “way more liberal than people would assume,” although he believes
there should be a cut-off point in pregnancy when termination is no longer
allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Critics of the 45-year-old are deeply suspicious about the
game plan behind NIUS — and Reichelt’s own personal motives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Hamburg-born son of two journalists, he rose to become
the top editor of Axel Springer’s Bild in 2017. But he was fired four years
later after facing allegations of lying to his employers over sexual
relationships with junior female staff — claims that he continues to deny and
battle in court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Andreas Audretsch, a Green MP who regularly locks horns with
the NIUS editor online, believes that Reichelt is driven by a “dangerous”
amalgamation of both political and personal goals, fuelled by the idea that
leftwing culture wars destroyed his career.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He seems to think that, if he is able to destroy the system
and the rules of our society, then something else will emerge,” he said. “And I
guess he doesn’t care if this is a rightwing extremist government.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt denied that he was seeking to destroy German
democracy. “Criticising the powerful is keeping the system of democracy alive,”
he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He said that he believes the AfD, which claimed a historic
second place finish in February elections and this year was labelled rightwing
extremist by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, has a few “ugly” figures
but added: “I don’t think it’s a Nazi party.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He also believes that the pact formed by mainstream parties
to avoid co-operating or forming coalitions with the AfD is “an insane
concept.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think we should be way more relaxed with the AfD because
we're a grown democracy,” he said. “We will be able to deal with it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Though shunned by most mainstream politicians, NIUS has
interviewed Jens Spahn and Markus Söder, senior figures from the CDU-CSU who
are both on the right of the conservative alliance. Audretsch, the Green MP,
said that such interviews signalled to conservative MPs “that it’s OK to talk
to Julian Reichelt, that NIUS is important — and if they're launching a
campaign, please start listening.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Thailand and Cambodia to meet for talks</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JOHN REED AND SUN NARIN — SIEM REAP</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Thai and Cambodian leaders will meet for talks today as
fighting continues in a conflict that has killed more than 30 people and
displaced more than 200,000 along their border.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two prime ministers are expected to meet in Kuala
Lumpur, after a weekend in which Thailand and Cambodia accused each other of
continued attacks and US President Donald Trump warned both countries that he
would cut off trade talks if they did not agree a ceasefire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand said yesterday evening that acting Prime Minister
Phumtham Wechayachai had been invited to a meeting by Malaysia’s Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
with Cambodian leader Hun Manet also expected to attend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand warned that it “reaffirms sovereignty over every
inch of its territory” and there would be “no negotiation on maps”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hun Manet said that he would lead the Cambodian delegation
to the meeting, which he said was “co-organised by the United States and with
participation of China” with the purpose of achieving “an immediate ceasefire”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The announcement came on the heels of Trump’s calls to the
Cambodian and Thai leaders. The worst fighting between Thailand and Cambodia in
more than a decade broke out on Thursday around the Ta Muen temple, which both
countries claim, before spreading to other parts of their border region.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump said in a social media post on Saturday that Cambodia
and Thailand “are also looking to get back to the ‘Trading Table’ with the
United States, which we think is inappropriate to do until such time as the
fighting STOPS”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump has threatened the two countries’ export-reliant
economies with a 36 per cent tariff from August 1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand’s foreign ministry said yesterday that Wechayachai
had spoken to Trump and that “Thailand agrees in principle to have a ceasefire
in place”, adding that it wanted to see “sincere intention” from Cambodia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hun Manet said that in his conversation with Trump,
“Cambodia agreed with the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire
between the two armed forces.” He added that he hoped “the Thai side will not
reverse position”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fighting continued yesterday, according to Thailand’s
army, which said that “the first shots were fired into Thai territory in
several areas including civilian homes”, and that it had “responded in
self-defence at limited military targets” since the violence began. Cambodia
said Thailand had been firing into its territory from 2am.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand has accused Cambodia of targeting civilian areas
and hospitals, which Cambodia's foreign ministry has dismissed as a “baseless
accusation”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yesterday, farmers from the border area in Cambodia could be
seen driving tractors with their possessions and families to safer areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A security guard who said he lived about 50km from the Preah
Vihear Hindu temple, a flashpoint in the fighting, said that he had heard about
Trump's intervention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I heard the news, but I don’t know why Thailand still fired
at 2am this morning,” Him Sum told the Financial Times at a roadside grocery
shop. “I think if the US wants to stop the war, they can.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Chile's far right advances as gangs cloud election</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=382 src="FT_files/image005.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CIARA NUGENT — SANTIAGO</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A surge in organised crime has reshaped Chile’s politics
ahead of November’s presidential poll, handing the country’s far right its best
chance at winning power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chile, one of Latin America’s safest and wealthiest nations,
has suffered its first big wave of gang crime over the past five years, as
groups from Venezuela and elsewhere have expanded Chile’s previously niche
markets for drugs, human trafficking and extortion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kidnappings, dismemberments and other once unheard-of
violent crimes have flooded local media and Chile’s murder rate has more than
doubled since 2015. Chileans have long ranked security among their top
concerns, but polls show the issue eclipses all others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That has benefited José Antonio Kast, a politician on his
third run for president who has made a career criticising governments’ handling
of crime and immigration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arturo Squella, president of Kast’s Republicano party, told
the Financial Times: “Chileans can clearly see that the other competitive
candidates have not had the determination to tackle drug traffickers and
organised crime head on. They see that determination in José Antonio Kast.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast promises to draw inspiration from El Salvador’s
President Nayib Bukele, and build a border barrier to keep out undocumented
migrants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A poll by opinion research group Cadem in July projected
Kast to win 27 per cent of the vote, putting him just behind the leftwing
coalition’s candidate, Jeannette Jara, at 29 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But several other rightwingers jointly scored about 25 per
cent, and analysts say Kast would more easily pick up those votes in a run-off
in December, making the election his to lose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast and Jara have political baggage that may put off
moderate voters. Kast, a son of German immigrants and a father of nine, is a
defender of Chile’s divisive 20th-century rightwing dictator Augusto Pinochet.
Jara is a member of the Communist party, which supports authoritarian regimes
in Cuba and North Korea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A Pinochetista has never won an election in Chile, but
neither has a communist,” said Patricio Navia, a professor at New York
University. “This looks like an unprecedented election.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crime, along with lacklustre economic growth, has battered
the popularity of leftist President Gabriel Boric, a former student leader. He
is barred from running for a second consecutive term under Chile’s
constitution. Jara was his labour minister.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boric’s government devoted the first half of his term to
failed efforts to expand Chile’s welfare state and overhaul its constitution. A
later pivot to focus on security, which he now calls his “number one priority”,
was not enough to convince voters and his approval ratings have rarely risen
above 30 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Officials say the arrival of hundreds of thousands of
migrants from crisis-stricken Venezuela, combined with a pullback in state
presence during the pandemic lockdowns, has allowed poorly policed informal
settlements to blossom and created a pool of vulnerable people to exploit,
particularly in northern Chile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Santiago has also changed. Downtown walls are still
plastered with graffiti from protests in 2019 over the cost of living. Informal
street vendors have proliferated and stores shut earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fatal shootings have frequently occurred in bustling
neighbourhoods around the capital’s Central Station and in July authorities
uncovered what appeared to be a “torture house” used by gangs. “Muggers used to
just take your cell phone, but now they’ll shoot you... people don’t go out at
night any more,” said Marco Gonzalez, who sells bathroom fixtures in the area
and plans to vote for Kast. “The government has been too weak to control it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boric’s government has increased security spending, passed
laws targeting organised crime and jailed hundreds of gang members, including
from Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The homicide rate has fallen slightly, from a peak of 6.7
per 100,000 residents in 2022 to six per 100,000 in 2024, and remains among the
lowest in Latin America. But other offences remain stubbornly high. A
government survey published in July found 5.8 per cent of Chileans had been the
victim of a violent crime last year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The state has intensely pursued these criminals ... and we
are achieving results,” security minister Luis Cordero said. “Of course, I
would like the results to come faster, but some will only be visible in the
medium or long term.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast argues the government has not gone far enough. He vows
to strengthen legal protections for police officers who use force, and make it
easier to deport migrants for entering illegally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last year, Kast visited El Salvador’s 40,000-capacity
mega-jail, whose harsh conditions have become the centrepiece of Bukele’s
crackdown on gangs. Squella said they would import “all the elements that are
appropriate in Chile”, including cutting off imprisoned gang members’ contact
with the outside world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We will reclaim the state’s right to use force, restore a
sense of authority, and make police work more proactive,” he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jara, meanwhile, has pledged to recover gang-controlled
neighbourhoods “by investing in infrastructure, culture and a permanent state
presence” and change banking laws to make it easier to track money laundering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast remains the favourite, but analysts said Jara, a
charismatic speaker who grew up in a working-class neighbourhood, was proving
to be an unexpectedly strong candidate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s a strong anti-elitism message within her, which has
worked in many countries recently,” said Robert Funk, an associate professor of
political science at the University of Chile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>China argues for global body to govern AI in challenge to
US dominance</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WILLIAM LANGLEY — GUANGZHOU<br>
ELEANOR OLCOTT AND RYAN MCMORROW — SHANGHAI</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China has unveiled a sweeping plan to expand its role in
artificial intelligence governance, including the creation of a global
co-operation organisation, as Beijing vies with Washington for technological
leadership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking at the opening of the World Artificial Intelligence
Conference in Shanghai on Saturday, Chinese premier Li Qiang said AI innovation
was hindered by “bottlenecks” such as the supply of computer chips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Without explicitly mentioning the US, he took aim at
“technological monopolies” and restrictions that could lead to AI becoming “an
exclusive game for a few countries and companies”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Currently, overall global AI governance is still
fragmented. Countries have great differences, particularly in terms of areas
such as regulatory concepts [and] institutional rules,” Li said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We should strengthen co-ordination to form a global AI
governance framework that has broad consensus as soon as possible,” he said,
adding that China would help create “a world AI co-operation organisation”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Li spoke, the foreign ministry published a 13-point
plan for the global governance of AI that proposed the creation of two new AI
dialogue mechanisms under the auspices of the UN and a safety governance
framework.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In recent months, Beijing has promoted China’s “open”
innovation and willingness to “share indigenous technologies”. The country’s
top AI groups, DeepSeek and Alibaba, have made their large language models, or
LLMs, available to developers worldwide as open-source technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s plan includes a push for greater co-operation on
open-source technology through new transnational platforms and developer
communities, and sharing of crucial software and hardware such as
semiconductors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The country’s swath of advanced open-source LLMs has raised
concerns in the US that low-cost Chinese tech will undermine Silicon Valley’s
global dominance and pricing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Li’s comments reflect the intense rivalry with the US over
the technology, with Washington restricting exports to China of advanced
semiconductors and the equipment used to make them, and pressing allies to do
the same. China has still managed to make advances, with the release of an LLM
by Hangzhou-based DeepSeek this year that sparked a debate about whether the US
could maintain its technological edge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We are willing to provide more Chinese solutions to the
international community and contribute more Chinese wisdom to global artificial
intelligence governance,” Li said, adding that AI would be a new engine of
economic growth. He said China was especially eager to share technologies with
countries in the global south to “make the achievements of AI development
better benefit the world”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s foreign ministry said it had invited representatives
from more than 40 countries and international organisations to attend the
four-day AI conference and exhibition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s plan comes days after the White House unveiled a
plan to achieve US dominance in AI. It focused on accelerating innovation by
cutting red tape, building infrastructure and ensuring the US led in
international AI diplomacy and security.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Brazil to increase its Brics commitment in defiance of
Trump</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MICHAEL STOTT — BRASILIA</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brazil will double down on its commitment to the Brics bloc,
the Brazilian president’s top foreign policy adviser has said, a move that
defies US President Donald Trump’s threats to impose punitive tariffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump has taken aim at Brazil twice this month. As the
country hosted a summit for the 11-member Brics, he threatened a 10 per cent
tariff against any nation “aligning themselves” with the “anti-American” bloc.
Trump then pledged 50 per cent levies on Brazil and demanded it end the trial
of hard-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is charged with plotting a
coup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Celso Amorim, lead foreign affairs adviser to leftwing
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, told the Financial Times those attacks
“are reinforcing our relations with the Brics, because we want to have
diversified relations and not depend on any one country.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On top of the Brics — which includes China, Russia and India
— Amorim said Brazil would look to bolster relations with other countries in
Europe, South America and Asia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 50 per cent tariff is among the highest mentioned by the
US president in his current round of negotiations, despite Brazil running a
trade deficit with the US in goods — unlike many other countries targeted.
Trump also blasted Lula’s government for what he said are attacks on free
speech, a “ridiculous censorship regime” and “very unfair” trade practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lula has rejected Trump's tactics, saying the US president
was elected “not to be emperor of the world”. He added that if Trump’s actions
during the January 6 Capitol insurrection had been committed in Brazil, he
would be standing trial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amorim said Trump’s interference in Brazil’s internal
affairs was something not seen “even in colonial times”. “I don’t think even
the Soviet Union would have done anything like this,” he said, adding that
Trump “was trying to act politically inside [Brazil] in favour of his friend.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While China is the country’s biggest trading partner,
importing $94bn of mainly agricultural goods and minerals from Brazil last
year, Amorim said “it’s not our intention” for Beijing to be the clear winner
from Trump’s higher tariffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amorim denied that the Brics is ideological. He called for
the EU to quickly ratify a long-stalled trade treaty with the Mercosur group of
South American countries. “If the EU were intelligent, it would ratify it not
just for the immediate economic gain but also for more balance in its
relations,” Amorim said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amorim said Canada was interested in negotiating a free
trade deal with Brazil, and added that the last year of Lula’s government was
likely to see greater focus on South America.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remembering the diplomatic maxim that “countries have no
friends, only interests,” Amorim said Trump was an unusual case because he had
“neither friends nor interests, just wishes”. The US president’s approach is
“an illustration of absolute power,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>More private equity backers opt to cash out than roll
over</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ALEXANDRA HEAL AND ANTOINE GARA — NEW YORK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Private equity investors are opting to cash out rather than
roll over their investments when buyout managers seek to hold on to portfolio
companies beyond the life of their funds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Between 85 and 92 per cent of investors have this year
chosen to sell rather than remain invested when private equity groups transfer
a portfolio company to a so-called continuation vehicle, rather than exiting
through a traditional sale or initial public offering — up from 75–80 per cent
last year, according to investment bank Houlihan Lokey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Private equity firms have flocked to the structures, which
allow them to hold on to portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year
lifespan of a fund by bringing in new investors and offering existing ones the
chance to sell their stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Buyout managers argue that continuation vehicles allow them
to retain their best assets and capture further value creation. But their
critics say the vehicles’ popularity is in part because sellers have struggled
to get high enough valuations for assets from external buyers in a tricky
dealmaking environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many private equity backers have instead been taking the
opportunity to sell their stakes in the portfolio company, rather than rolling
their holdings into the new fund, according to Matt Swain, global co-head of
equity capital solutions at Houlihan Lokey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Investors in private equity funds, such as pension funds and
endowments, were “welcoming distributions from [continuation vehicles] with
open arms” because they had “experienced a dearth of liquidity in recent
years”, Swain said, with a lack of traditional exits. Last year private capital
firms sold $62bn of assets into continuation funds, according to advisory firm
Campbell Lutyens, up almost 50 per cent on the year before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Swain predicted that this year 10–15 per cent of all private
equity exits could be done through such vehicles. Jefferies recently calculated
that the vehicles had led to almost 20 per cent of sales across the industry in
the first half of the year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Continuation vehicles usually combine capital from three
sources: specialist secondaries funds dedicated to buying existing private
equity assets; cash committed by the private equity manager; and money rolled
over by the backers of the original buyout fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The vehicles can either house just one portfolio company —
an approach used on prize assets but one that results in a concentrated risk
profile — or multiple assets, where the risk is more diverse but the assets can
include underperforming bets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last year at least two continuation vehicles failed, the
first large blow-ups in the industry. Wheel Pros, a car parts maker on which
buyout group Clearlake had reaped nearly $1bn in profits on selling it into a
continuation fund, filed for bankruptcy, leaving the equity investors in the
newer fund with large losses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mustafa Siddiqui, founder of secondaries investment firm SQ
Capital, said continuation vehicles were used where a buyout fund did not want
“to give the future growth in value to someone else” and for “lemons” that they
could not sell to a conventional buyer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Record flows Chinese investors drive revival in Hong Kong
stocks to end post-Covid slump</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=552 src="FT_files/image006.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WILLIAM SANDLUND AND HAOHSIANG KO — HONG KONG<br>
THOMAS HALE — SHANGHAI</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chinese investment flows to Hong Kong through the Stock
Connect programme have hit a record high as mainland capital drives a revival
of the territory’s equities market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About HK$820bn (US$104bn) of Chinese money has been invested
this year through Stock Connect, which links the mainland’s stock exchanges to
Hong Kong’s, surpassing 2024's full-year inflow of HK$807.9bn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The surge has helped end a post-Covid slump in Hong Kong’s
financial markets and underlines how the city’s fortunes have become
increasingly dependent on policy in Beijing and on Chinese capital.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It also points to a growing appetite among Chinese investors
to put money to work outside the mainland’s tightly controlled financial
system, as yields on government bonds have fallen to record lows amid an
uncertain economic backdrop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Domestic investors are now waking up to the opportunity
offshore,” said Jason Lui, head of Asia-Pacific equity and derivative strategy
at BNP Paribas. “If you're [Chinese] institutional investors, you have no
choice but to start looking outward. There’s actually limited choices for where
you can go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Stock Connect programme, which started in 2014, allows
Chinese retail investors with at least Rmb500,000 ($70,000) to access Hong
Kong’s financial markets without violating China’s strict capital controls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cumulative investment into Hong Kong through Stock Connect
has reached HK$4.5tn, with more than a third of inflows occurring in the past
two years. Southbound transactions now make up about a quarter of daily
turnover on the Hong Kong exchange’s main board, compared with well below 10
per cent on most days in 2019.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The programme is one of the only ways Chinese investors can
buy shares of technology companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, which
are listed in Hong Kong but not in the mainland. Their shares have rallied
sharply this year following the release of a groundbreaking artificial
intelligence model by Chinese start-up DeepSeek and signs of easing tensions
between China’s tech sector and regulators.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hong Kong’s listings pipeline has hit a record high this
year as mainland companies pursue secondary listings in the city. “The Hong
Kong stock exchange has become the main platform for mainland companies to
raise offshore capital,” said David Tsai, a partner at law firm Clifford
Chance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hong Kong’s turnaround has helped rekindle investor interest
in Chinese businesses that were hit by a government crackdown on the private
sector and a property market slowdown now in its fourth year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The longer-term outlook for Hong Kong has improved,” said
James Wang, head of China equity strategy at UBS. “You're not hearing investors
saying: ‘Is China investable any more?’ That kind of rhetoric is well and truly
behind us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Anthropic in funding talks that double its valuation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GEORGE HAMMOND — SAN FRANCISCO<br>
IVAN LEVINGSTON — WASHINGTON<br>
JAMES FONTANELLA-KHAN — NEW YORK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>A</i>rtificial intelligence start-up Anthropic is in
early talks to more than double its valuation to above $150bn in a new funding
round, giving it greater firepower to keep pace with rivals building advanced
AI models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The competitor to Sam Altman’s OpenAI is in the preliminary
stages of funding discussions with investors and has received interest from
backers willing to value the business at more than $150bn, a huge jump from
Anthropic’s current $61.5bn price tag, according to four people with knowledge
of the matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two of the people said final terms had not been fixed but
the four-year-old company was expected to raise at least $3bn, with one adding
that the round could reach up to $5bn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The start-up has spoken to large Middle Eastern investors
and received interest from MGX, Abu Dhabi’s vast AI investment fund, about
joining the new round, according to two of the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anthropic has resisted raising money directly from the
Middle East, although another Abu Dhabi state fund linked to MGX purchased
almost $500mn of Anthropic shares from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX last year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a note to staff, chief executive Dario Amodei warned that
taking Middle East investment could “enrich dictators”. But he added:
“Unfortunately, I think ‘no bad person should ever benefit from our success’ is
a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.” Anthropic and MGX declined
to comment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The group is changing tack amid a fierce battle for funding
that has seen AI start-ups look beyond Silicon Valley to sovereign wealth
funds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anthropic is backed by Google and Amazon. The Financial
Times previously reported that Amazon has discussed plans for further
investment beyond its current $8bn commitment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anthropic is racing OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Big Tech
rivals including Google and Meta to develop AI models capable of producing
text, code and images. Despite their rapid growth, neither Anthropic nor OpenAI
is close to being profitable, with both burning cash to pay for the huge amount
of computing power needed to train their models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Rail groups hope Trump effect keeps tie-up on track</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ROBERT WRIGHT — LONDON</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=373 height=361 src="FT_files/image007.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Jim Vena, chief executive of Union Pacific, announced
last Thursday that the US’s biggest railway had made significant progress in
talks on merging with another network, he used deceptively humdrum language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The company was “in advanced talks” with Norfolk Southern,
the US’s fourth-biggest railway, about a “potential business combination”, he
told participants in the company’s second-quarter results conference call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet to observers and analysts of freight railways in the US
and Canada, Union Pacific’s plans are far more than just another “business
combination”. A successful deal would destroy the widespread assumption that
big Canadian and US railways — which handle about 40 per cent of intercity
freight movements — had become so consolidated that regulators would block any
new attempted merger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A $200bn combination of Union Pacific — which operates west
of the Mississippi — and Norfolk Southern, on the east, would be the first
operator in US railways’ 200-year history able to carry goods all the way from
the Pacific coast to the Atlantic on its own tracks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The deal could prompt BNSF, the other big western railway,
owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, to consider a tie-up with CSX,
the other big network in the east, according to many analysts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tony Hatch, an independent analyst, said the talks had
surprised an industry that stopped expecting new deals after Canadian Pacific
bought Kansas City Southern in 2023. “The thinking was that this would be the
last merger,” Hatch said. “All of a sudden, there’s been a revival of
interest.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Henry Posner, a veteran rail investor and chair of the Iowa
Interstate Railroad, said there could still be considerable opposition from
customers to the creation of a behemoth with the power that a transcontinental
railway would wield. “At the industry level, it’s hard to imagine a
constituency that’s anxious to see a transcontinental railroad merger,” he
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The big question is whether industry regulator the Surface
Transportation Board has changed sufficiently under US President Donald Trump
to brush aside precedent and clear a deal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another question is whether it would approve a “voting
trust”, a key mechanism that in past US rail mergers has allowed shareholders
in a target company to sell up and avoid the risks of the STB’s laborious
approval process, which typically takes at least 18 months.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At a conference in May, Keith Creel, chief executive of the
merged Canadian Pacific Kansas City, pointed out that any new deal would take
place under tough rules introduced in 2001 that required any transaction to
“enhance competition”. Those rules did not apply to the 2023 deal because
Kansas City Southern had an exemption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There is... not a hill of regulatory risk to climb,” Creel
said. “There’s mountains of regulatory risk.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nevertheless, Union Pacific’s advisers appear confident a
deal is possible. Vena has used language apparently calculated to appeal to
Trump's economic nationalism. In an interview with industry magazine Trains,
published in May before the Norfolk Southern talks became public, Vena said: “I
think it’s a win for our customers and a win for competition, and it’s a win
for how the country should move ahead.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advocates for a merger have argued that creation of a single
transcontinental railway would improve the industry’s structure. There are two
big western networks, two big networks in the east, and CPKC and Canadian
National competing in Canada and parts of the US. Long-distance freight often
has to be handed over between operators, frequently in Chicago, which becomes
congested at busy times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hatch said there was also potential for a merged rail
network to make a better job of handling “watershed” traffic from the areas
near the Mississippi that needed to go relatively short distances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet even if it approves a merger, the STB could still demand
in return that a network sell some of its routes to a rival or allow another
operator to use parts of its track.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hatch pointed out in a note to clients this week that any
merger might face opposition from large customers worried that a merged network
would enjoy far more power to raise prices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Posner, who sits on a committee advising the STB on
passenger rail issues, insisted there was no certainty the regulator would bend
with the political wind. The board has a Republican chair but only one other
Republican member, alongside two Democrats and a vacant seat. “I think the STB
is somewhat removed from political pressure,” Posner said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On top of the approval concerns, there is a strong chance
the regulator might bar the use of a “voting trust”. In past rail mergers,
shareholders in the selling company have sold their shares to an independent
entity which has overseen the railroad’s operations during the 18 months to two
years that the STB takes to consider a deal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Canadian National failed in a counterbid to Canadian
Pacific’s offer for Kansas City Southern, partly because the regulator barred
it from using a voting trust. Hatch said that, without the trust structure,
shareholders would face an unattractive period of uncertainty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It remains possible, according to analysts, that Union
Pacific will navigate the many challenges and succeed in its bid to reshape US
freight rail’s competitive landscape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet Hatch stressed that there remained considerable
uncertainties. “We've long thought that the risk and the cost would overwhelm
the benefits,” Hatch said of a potential deal. “It appears that Union Pacific
now think they have a handle on that and they can pull off enough benefit to
make the risks worth it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>AI groups seek to curb chatbot ‘hallucinations’</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MELISSA HEIKKILÄ — LONDON</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=351 src="FT_files/image008.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=329 height=931 src="FT_files/image009.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The leading artificial intelligence groups are stepping up
efforts to reduce the number of “hallucinations” in large language models, as
they seek to solve one of the big obstacles limiting take-up of the powerful
technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Google, Amazon, Cohere and Mistral are among those trying to
bring down the rate of these fabricated answers by rolling out technical fixes,
improving the quality of the data in AI models, and building verification and
fact-checking systems across their generative AI products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The move to reduce these so-called hallucinations is seen as
crucial to increase the use of AI tools across industries such as law and
health, which require accurate information, and help boost the AI sector’s
revenues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It comes as chatbot errors have already resulted in costly
mistakes and litigation. Last year, a tribunal ordered Air Canada to honour a
discount that its customer service chatbot had made up, and lawyers who have
used AI tools in court documents have faced sanctions after it made up
citations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But AI experts warn that eliminating hallucinations
completely from large language models is impossible because of how the systems
operate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hallucinations are a very hard problem to fix because of
the probabilistic nature of how these models work,” said Amr Awadallah, a
former Google executive and founder of Vectara, a generative AI agent start-up.
“You will never get them to not hallucinate.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These errors occur because large language models are
designed to predict the next likely word in a sentence based on statistics they
have learnt from their training data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These mistakes can look like either factual inaccuracies or
the model not aligning with instructions by, for example, summarising events
from the wrong year. What data goes into an AI model’s training set is
important, because the more often a piece of information appears, the more
likely it is that the model will repeat it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The amount that AI models hallucinate varies significantly.
Vectara, which has created a leaderboard tracking these errors, found that some
can hallucinate as little as 0.8 per cent of the time while others as much as
29.9 per cent when asked to summarise a document.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rate of hallucinations initially went up with a new
generation of AI models that are able to “reason”, or solve problems step by
step. This is probably because they are iterating inside of themselves for
longer in order to solve problems in different ways, which leads to a higher
probability of mistakes, said Awadallah. However, the rate of hallucinations
has gone down, as companies have learnt how to build better safeguards for the
models, he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But its research showed that when AI systems are “grounded”
in other sources of information, such as online search, news articles or
internal company documents — rather than just relying on training data — the
number of errors is reduced significantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>AI groups have been focusing on this “grounded” approach to
work out the best methods to help reduce hallucinations as much as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A common technique used by labs is called
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which searches for information from
outside sources, which can be used to fact check claims made by AI systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chatbots from companies such as Cohere, Mistral, Google
DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic offer citations, which show users the sources
they based their generated texts on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In January, French AI start-up Mistral struck a
multimillion-euro deal with Agence France-Presse to incorporate thousands of
the newswire’s articles into its chatbot to boost its fact checking. Both
Mistral and Canadian AI group Cohere also allow their models to be plugged into
the internal data sources of their customers, which allows them to refer to
internal documents for fact checking. That way, the model is grounded in the
context and information that customers want it to process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If you want the model to not hallucinate and to be very
precise . . . the best way is to plug it to the internal databases,” said
Alexandre Sablayrolles, who leads work on agents and RAG at Mistral.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Byron Cook, vice-president and scientist at Amazon Web
Services, believes that applying mathematical logic and reasoning can also help
minimise hallucinations. This led the group to introduce a new safeguard in
December, called automated reasoning checks, that works as an additional test
by its models to validate the accuracy of its responses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some companies, such as Google DeepMind, Cohere, Mistral and
Vectara, also use smaller “evaluator” language models specifically trained to
check the outputs of another language model for errors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most models have the option for developers to toggle the
so-called temperature or how randomly the model should generate the next likely
word. But even the most rigorous technical fixes will not ensure complete
truthfulness, said Nick Frosst, co-founder of Cohere. “It’s not like we can
train a model to only say true things because what is true is dependent on what
is going on in the world,” said Frosst. “And that’s changing and it’s dependent
on your own point of view in some situations.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allowing AI models to search the internet for information
also makes them susceptible to an attack called prompt injection, said
Vectara’s Awadallah. This is where a third party can insert false information
into places where large language models check their information, such as Reddit
and Wikipedia or other websites. This information can then make the AI model
present false information as facts, or disregard its guard rails and
“misbehave”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Google launched its new AI search tool last year, it
told users to put glue on pizza and eat rocks after someone had jokingly posted
that on Reddit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of the challenge for AI developers is reaching a
balance between verifying information for accuracy and enabling the model to be
“creative”. “Building creativity into models makes them more useful but then it
can also lead to more creative, rather than factual, answers,” said Google
DeepMind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>AWS’s Cook noted that hallucinations could also sometimes be
“desired” by users. “If you're trying to write poetry with them, then that’s
actually pretty good. You are looking for weird answers that find weird
connections between things,” said Cook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cohere’s Frosst warned that even the term hallucination was
misleading. “It sounds too much like [the model] working the way a human brain
works, and it does not,” he said. “It works in a completely different way.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>US boards hire more 'boomerang CEOs'</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Number of top bosses<br>
returning to jobs they held<br>
before hits 10-year high</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>STEPHEN FOLEY AND ALEXANDRA WHITE<br>
NEW YORK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The number of &quot;boomerang CEOs&quot; — corporate bosses
who have been brought back for a second stint in the top job — is at a 10-year
high in the US as boards of directors increasingly reach back to the past to
fill gaps in their succession plans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A burst of reappointments in the past nine months, after a
record year for boomerang hiring in 2023, means that 22 companies in the
S&amp;P 1500 are now run by chief executives who have returned to the role,
according to recruitment consultancy Spencer Stuart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They range from household names such as Disney, where Bob
Iger stepped back in to replace his successor as chief executive in 2022, and
Dell Technologies, where founder Michael Dell is on a second stint in charge,
to smaller companies in semiconductors, retail and homebuilding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the latest example this month, Microchip Technology
announced that Steve Sanghi, who ran the company for 30 years until 2021 and
returned last year as interim chief executive, would keep the top job on a
permanent basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Boards have gotten better and more systematic at
succession planning,&quot; said Jim Citrin, head of Spencer Stuart's CEO
practice, &quot;and the key question is, what are all the options? Boomerang
CEOs have tended to be pretty high-profile so now, as part of every succession
planning conversation, it's one of the options.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spencer Stuart data suggests boomerang CEOs typically fail
to match the shareholder returns of their first term during their second
innings. After outperforming the market by 5.5 per cent a year on average
during their first stint, they underperform by 7.4 per cent during their
second, according to its analysis of 86 boomerang CEOs in the S&amp;P 1500
since 2000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The number of boomerang CEOs remains relatively small
overall but the increase has raised questions among investors who assume that
management is grooming the next generation of potential leaders and boards of
directors are casting the net widely for talent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's probably easier and also in some cases prudent to
go to a trusted individual but that doesn't lessen the potential concern of
lack of succession planning for the longer term,&quot; said Bob McCormick,
executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boomerang CEOs are often founders or longtime bosses who are
brought back to put a company on an even keel during a period of turmoil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In May, for example, UnitedHealth, the medical insurance
group, reappointed Stephen Hemsley to replace Sir Andrew Witty after the
company slashed profit forecasts and came under regulatory scrutiny.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jun Frank, head of governance and compensation advisory for
ISS-Corporate, said: &quot;Asking someone to come back is not a sign of bad
governance per se, but it does speak to challenges for the company and may
indicate potential trouble at the board level.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Experts hired for smarter large language models</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>MELISSA HEIKKILÄ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=373 height=370 src="FT_files/image010.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Top artificial intelligence groups are replacing low-cost
&quot;data labellers&quot; in Africa and Asia with highly paid industry
specialists, in the latest push to build &quot;smarter&quot; and more powerful
models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Companies such as Scale AI, Turing and Toloka are hiring
experts in fields such as biology and finance to help AI groups create more
sophisticated training data that is crucial for developing the next generation
of AI systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rise of so-called &quot;reasoning&quot; models, such as
OpenAI's 03 and Google's Gemini 2.5, has accelerated the move away from
employing thousands of low-cost workers in countries such as Kenya and the
Philippines, who are typically paid less than $2 an hour to undertake the
time-consuming task of annotating the huge datasets used to train AI models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The AI industry was for a long time heavily focused on
the models and compute, and data has always been an overseen part of AI,&quot;
said Olga Megorskaya, chief executive and co-founder of Dutch group Toloka.
&quot;Finally, [the industry] is accepting the importance of the data for
training.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This shift has led to a surge in investor interest in
data-labelling start-ups. In June, Meta invested $15bn in the US group Scale
AI, doubling its valuation to $29bn, as part of a push to catch up with rivals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In March, California-based Turing AI raised $111mn at a
$2.2bn valuation, while Jeff Bezos's personal firm Bezos Expeditions led a
$72mn investment round for Toloka in May.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Previously, data labellers would handle simple tasks, such
as drawing boxes on images to identify objects, describing what images
represent, selecting fluent ways to express things and weeding out bad answers
from datasets that often contained violent or graphic content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because AI models need more data to perform better, these
workers were expected to process tasks in seconds and complete hundreds of
tasks during a working day to create vast datasets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, the demand for these tasks had dropped significantly as
many of them could be automated, said Megorskaya.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joan Kinyua, president of the Data Labelers Association in
Kenya, said workers were now being tasked with jobs that relied on localised
language skills and knowledge. The group had also seen jobs in which human
labellers were tasked with conducting final quality control checks for
AI-generated content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As leading AI groups such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Google
attempt to develop models that they claim will exceed human intelligence, there
is a push to focus on the quality of datasets and hiring experts to examine
complex problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What these models now need is data of a real human
using the models to do knowledge work, and getting feedback on when the model
is failing,&quot; said Jonathan Siddharth, co-founder and chief executive of
Turing AI.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To ensure that models perform well in a wide variety of
fields, from coding to physics and finance, deep-pocketed AI companies are now
willing to pay for more sophisticated datasets and experts from around the
world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To attract people from different industries, Turing paid
experts 20-30 per cent more than they received in their current jobs, said
Siddharth. While budgets for data are only about 10-15 per cent of the hundreds
of billions of dollars AI companies spend on computing power, it remained an
&quot;enormous amount of money,&quot; he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>New features and capabilities, such as chain of thought,
which shows how AI models solve problems step by step, were developed by having
human experts show how they broke down problems, said Toloka's Megorskaya.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Experienced software engineers might also be asked to come
up with tasks that are relevant for their field, and then solve them by writing
code, debugging it and checking for security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, validating a physics theory would require
contributions from a physicist to articulate how to build a simulator to test
whether the theory is true, a software engineer to code the simulator and a
data scientist to analyse the results of the simulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The result of this is the model's not just going to be
better than a physicist. It's going to be better than a superposition of
somebody who's at the top in physics, computer science and data science,&quot;
said Turing's Siddharth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Why giving up finance to go back to school can fail</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Craig Coben<br>
After the Bell</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Rodney Dangerfield's 1986 comedy&nbsp;<i>Back to School</i>,
a wealthy tycoon enrols at his son's university and treats academia like just
another business deal. He throws epic parties and hires experts to do his
coursework, such as paying Kurt Vonnegut to ghostwrite a paper on Kurt
Vonnegut. The film's humour lies in the clash between real-world business
practices and academic standards. The professor, for example, gives the
Vonnegut essay an &quot;F&quot;, saying it failed to understand the author's
work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Life sometimes imitates art. While many retiring financiers
pursue board seats or advisory roles, others return to the classroom, searching
for intellectual renewal or maybe just a do-over of their wayward youth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On paper, it sounds idyllic: trading the conference room for
the seminar room, PowerPoint for Plutarch. Academia promises liberation from
client demands, &quot;stretch&quot; revenue targets and quarterly reviews. It
is in part later-life reinvention and in part nostalgia for the carefree
student life that slipped by too quickly - now revisited with the wisdom of
experience but without the old anxieties about grades and exams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reality is often less romantic. What thrilled you at 20
can feel trivial or impractically abstract at 55. Returning to university often
reveals how much you have changed - and how little academia has.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I've spoken to several former colleagues and competitors who
attempted this late-career pivot. The results have been mixed. One ex-banker
enrolled in a computer science master's programme, hoping to co-found an
artificial intelligence venture with a professor, who turned out to have no
commercial acumen. Another began a PhD in economics but left after getting a
master's, disillusioned by departmental turf wars and the asphyxiating
narrowness of academic research. A third did finish a doctorate in anthropology,
enjoying the fieldwork more than the coursework and finding the dissertation a
tedious slog to write.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The adjustment to academic life can be jarring. After years
in senior roles, it is not easy to take instruction from lecturers who may be
decades younger. Academic theories often struggle to account for the messy
ambiguity of real-world business. Where once you wrote one-page memos and used
bullet points in presentations, you're now expected to produce dense,
citation-heavy prose. Concise writing and presentational fluency can come
across as shallow or glib in scholarly settings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The generational gap adds friction. Group projects with
classmates 30 years younger can test your patience. Their certainty may strike
you as naive and dogmatic; you've seen enough market cycles to know how few
things are absolute. But then again, you were once as confidently opinionated
as they are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's the issue. You can't go back because you're no
longer who you were. You're more seasoned, more sceptical. You want to cut to
the point and see the practical application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Logistics complicate things further. Relocating for school
was simple in your late teens or early twenties. At 55 or 60, with a family,
ageing parents, or other obligations, it's not. It's also hard to justify
uprooting your life for a course that may offer few post-graduation
opportunities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, the vision of academia as a fresh career springboard
rarely survives contact with reality. The jobs market does not clamor for
58-year-old graduates with shiny new degrees in biomechanical ethics or
advanced numismatics. A few former financiers I know have secured prestigious
consulting or policy roles but they are outliers. Ageism remains the last
&quot;condonable prejudice&quot; in hiring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For some, this doesn't matter. They're not seeking a career
reboot but something more profound - the chance to discover fresh direction and
purpose and to have a positive social impact. Programmes such as Harvard's
Advanced Leadership Initiative and Stanford's Distinguished Careers Institute
cater to this urge, offering senior professionals a curated curriculum that
combines coursework, networking and bespoke events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friends who have attended rave about them. But with tuition
costs in the region of $70,000, no formal degree and a small number of learning
fellows, they are niche offerings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not everyone returns as a student. A former European
business school dean told me many ex-bankers apply to teach. Some land adjunct
roles - but full-time posts are rare because accreditation rules require a high
proportion of PhDs on the faculty. The appeal is not the modest pay but the
chance to mentor, rather than manage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One former banker I know, now a tenured B-school professor,
keeps 1980s deals &quot;tombstones&quot; - small plaques that commemorate a big
transaction, such as a merger or IPO on his campus office bookshelf and says
students appreciate hearing the war stories.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Retiring bankers can revisit the classroom but not the
person they were when they first walked in. You don't get a second youth, just
a new perspective shaped by experience. And as Dangerfield's character learns,
hiring Vonnegut isn't the same as understanding him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Fed under presidential pressure for rate cut</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=395 src="FT_files/image011.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Will the Fed bow to pressure from Trump for a rate cut?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep
interest rates on hold when it meets this week — despite intense pressure from
US President Donald Trump for a cut — investors will be watching closely for
any hints from chair Jay Powell about the pace of future easing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Markets are currently pricing in a less than 3 per cent
chance that the Fed will cut this month but economists surveyed by Reuters
still expect at least one quarter-point reduction later this year, while
futures markets expect one with a high chance of a second by December.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Fed has been under unusually high pressure from the
president, who has been scrutinising the cost of refurbishing its Washington
headquarters as he steps up his attacks on the chair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump, who appointed Powell in 2017, has called him a
“numbskull” in recent weeks. Powell’s term as chair is set to end next year.
Members of the Federal Open Market Committee have recently been divided on the
issue of whether and when to cut. As of June’s “dot plot” release, 10
rate-setters favoured at least one rate cut by the end of 2025 while seven
preferred no cuts this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It will be interesting to watch whether Powell alludes to
some potential policy easing before year-end, or if he refrains from providing
any explicit forward guidance, given the strong FOMC split,” said Gregory Daco,
chief economist at EY-Parthenon, who said he expects two quarter-point cuts in
2025 and the equivalent of four such reductions in 2026.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Goldman Sachs analyst Jessica Rindels said this month that
she and her colleagues continue to expect three quarter-point cuts, one in each
of the Fed’s upcoming September, October and December meetings, plus a
half-point worth of cuts in 2026. — Will Schmitt</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does the Bank of Japan view the trade deal with the US? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Investors will be eager to hear how policymakers think the
trade deal clinched between Washington and Tokyo will shift the outlook for
growth and inflation, when the Bank of Japan meets this week. Shinichi Uchida,
the central bank’s deputy governor, said this month that uncertainty had
receded because of the deal, a signal that it could be more likely to resume
its tightening cycle. It last raised the policy rate by a quarter-point to
“around 0.5 per cent” in January, the highest level in 17 years. Traders are
putting a minuscule probability on a rate rise this week, according to levels
implied by swaps markets, but are ascribing a two-thirds chance of it coming by
October. “We're becoming more confident in our forecast that the bank will
resume its tightening cycle at its October meeting,” said Marcel Thieliant,
head of Asia- Pacific at Capital Economics. Concerns that the trade deal “could
end up being deflationary in Japan have proved unfounded”, Thieliant added.
However, core year-on-year inflation tracked by the Tokyo Consumer Price index
for July, published on Friday, came in at 2.9 per cent, slightly below the 3
per cent economists had expected. The Bo] “will not be rushing to resume
raising rates”, said analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman. Jan Smith European
Central Bank president Chris- tine Lagarde described its policymakers as being
in “wait-and-watch” mode last week, as they looked for clear evidence of how
global trade turmoil is affecting the Eurozone economy. There will be plenty
for them to watch this week, as a slew of data offers potentially important
signals about how growth and inflation are faring ahead of the August 1
deadline for a trade deal between the US and the EU. After strong growth in the
first quarter fuelled by companies frontloading ahead of tariffs,
second-quarter GDP data due on Wednesday is expected to show year-on-year
growth slowed to 1.2 per cent in the second quarter, according to economists
polled by Reuters. Bert Colijn, an economist at ING, said the GDP figure is
likely to be a “reality check” for Europe, and that “the impact of US
developments on Eurozone GDP will likely have been negative”. Growth data will
then be followed by inflation on Friday, which economists polled by Reuters
expect to have fallen to 1.9 per cent in July, down from 2 per cent in June.
Both data points could alter investors’ views about how the ECB will approach
the rest of this year. Lagarde’s comments, as well as growing optimism about a
US-EU trade deal that could help economic growth, led investors to trim the
probability of a further rate cut this year to about 60 per cent. With doubts
starting to emerge in the market about the chance of another rate reduction,
this week’s data could be influential. Stronger than expected inflation or GDP
figures could mean that bets on another cut to the benchmark rate evaporate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But aircon sits awkwardly with global warming, net zero
targets and energy efficiency goals. It is also a perennial office irritant:
those sitting under a vent have to wrap up warm, views often differ on the
ideal temperature and there is greater awareness of germs floating through
recycled air in a post-pandemic environment. With temperatures rising, the
International Energy Agency has warned that aircon is set to be a huge driver
for electricity demand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enter the offices of the future. In the City of London,
proposed developments at 50 Fenchurch Street and 63 St Mary Axe, and the
recently built 8 Bishopsgate, will use energy efficient underfloor cooling
systems that raise oxygen levels and reduce pathogens, while also employing
radical new ideas such as opening the windows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At 63 St Mary’s Axe, which was approved this month by the
City of London Corporation, an underfloor &quot;displacement&quot; system will
pump in large volumes of cool air through the floor, which will rise as it
warms. At night, windows at the top of the building will open automatically to
let the hot air escape. A similar method will be used at 50 Fenchurch Street,
which Andrew MacKay, associate director at the building's designer, Arup, says
will bring about 30 per cent more outside air into the building. That will lead
to higher oxygen levels, which studies say increase cognitive ability - and
worker productivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MacKay predicts that within five years most new buildings
will have this system, which he notes is also easier on the eye. &quot;When you
walk into the spaces you don't see cooling systems on the ceiling, pipes or
ducts. It's a visually cleaner space.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of the interest in improvements came during the
pandemic when people started to think about the air around them, says Ed
Williams, managing partner at Fletcher Priest Architects, who is working on the
63 St Mary Axe building. &quot;The perception of being able to control your
environment more is a huge benefit that's hard to measure&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most buildings will not allow workers to open the windows
themselves—a sure-fire way to create tension among colleagues over temperature
and draughts. But more are using smart systems to boost the amount of natural
air. The headquarters of Australian tech giant Atlassian in Sydney will use
temperature and wind sensors to determine when to open and shut the windows,
for example. The tower at 8 Bishopsgate will rely on a rooftop sensor to
automatically lower blinds when the sun is stronger, reducing the need for
artificial cooling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Green spaces can also improve air quality. At 63 St Mary
Axe, every floor will have garden access. &quot;That's a fundamental shift you
wouldn't have seen 10 years ago,&quot; says Robert Samuel at Axa IM Alts, the
developer of the building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Williams notes that his team creates taller office spaces
now—helped by the lack of aircon units in the ceilings—to get more daylight
into floors and help with air circulation. &quot;From a designer's point of
view, Covid has been a big benefit as you have to work harder to create spaces
that people want to leave their homes for,&quot; he says.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kriston Symons, an engineer in Arup's Sydney office, says
they used to have a lot of complaints about air conditioning but those have
plummeted over the past decade. One reason is that people who have been working
from home are more likely to be grateful for the office aircon. Another is the
trend towards hot desking and agile working—people are better able to move
around the office to seek out the right temperature for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At 80 Charlotte Street, Arup's London headquarters, workers
can choose where to sit based on air quality. &quot;We're a tech company and
we're all nerds, so we have air quality monitoring all around the building, in
terms of CO2 levels, pollutant levels, temperature and humidity so you can move
around and sit where you're most comfortable,&quot; says MacKay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other advances in technology have made less abrasive cooling
systems possible, MacKay adds: because LED lights give off less heat and cloud
computing has led to fewer big servers in offices, cooling systems can be
lighter touch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some developers remain wary of new technology, which is not
yet tried and tested. Designers also admit the most radical new cooling methods
cannot be realistically applied to existing buildings for cost reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But companies can still improve their workplaces by tweaking
existing systems, points out Brian Motherway, head of energy efficiency and
inclusive transitions at the International Energy Agency. He says offices could
make big savings by just turning up the aircon temperature a couple of degrees
and installing electric fans near people's desks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Electric fans use up to 40 times less electricity than
aircon units, he says, while also giving individuals more control. Women tend
to feel colder than men and some studies have even suggested their cognitive
ability is better at higher temperatures—a further win-win for companies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Developers are also often not using the most energy
efficient aircon models, Motherway says. Governments could play a role here—in
Japan it is common for standards on the best aircon units to be reviewed and
revised upwards more frequently than in other countries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Companies should also talk directly to their workers about
whether they are happy with the temperature, he adds. The likelihood is that
many find it too cold anyway</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Economic uncertainty and offshoring may fuel the decline
in entry-level roles, write Clara Murray and Delphine Strauss</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The rise of ChatGPT made me realise — I’m going to lose my
interpreter job,” said Sophia Sheng. After a degree in advanced translation,
the 23-year-old is now studying for a masters in management at the University
of Manchester, having seen friends in the industry struggle. “I have this fear
that someday a lot of jobs are going to be replaced by AI... [That’s] why I
chose to shift to a completely new field.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many young graduates now share Sheng’s existential fear that
AI will gobble up entry-level white-collar positions and put them out of work
altogether. Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, warned in May that half
of “administrative, managerial and tech jobs for people under 30” could vanish
within five years. Big graduate employers such as BT, PwC and Microsoft are
cutting jobs, while half of UK companies want to redirect money from staff to
AI, according to a BCG survey published in January.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Job postings for entry-level roles requiring a degree have
dropped by almost two-thirds in the UK since 2022 — the year ChatGPT launched —
twice as much as for all starter roles, according to job search engine Adzuna.
In the US, such listings are down 43 per cent over the same period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet while the data points to a tough landscape for new
graduates, it also indicates the causes are more nuanced. AI may be part of the
picture but other factors, including economic uncertainty, post-Covid
retrenchment and offshoring are probably playing an equal or bigger role in
falling graduate hiring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is so far only tentative evidence in some of the most
immediately exposed occupations of AI-related disruption, according to an FT
analysis of the latest available data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advertisements for graduate-level roles have plunged in
several sought-after UK sectors thought to be highly at risk from AI. They were
down by 75 per cent in banking and finance, 65 per cent in software development
and 54 per cent in accounting in June this year compared with the same month in
2019, according to data from job search site Indeed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But listings have also fallen sharply in fields identified
as being under less acute pressure from generative AI, such as human resources,
which was down 77 per cent, and civil engineering, where there had been a 55
per cent drop in openings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oliver Nash, associate director at the Institute for the
Future of Work (IFOW), said there were “multiple drivers” of the hiring
downturn, from the Labour government’s fiscal changes to a decrease in VC
funding and a slowdown in the public sector headcount. “Large increases in
hiring during Covid, especially in tech... could now be being corrected through
a natural process of normalisation,” he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Separate analysis by Indeed found only a weak link between
occupations where overall postings, including non-graduate roles, fell most,
and those where job descriptions had most mentions of AI (suggesting hirers had
rapidly adopted the technology).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pawel Adrjan, director of EMEA economic research at Indeed,
said the findings were likely to reflect the tech sector’s particular problems
and a broader downturn in the UK jobs market. “Against this backdrop, it’s hard
to distinguish any possible subtle impacts of AI.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, FT analysis of US official data showed there was
no clear correlation between an occupation’s potential exposure to generative
AI (on an International Labour Organization measure of the tasks susceptible to
automation), and whether it lost young workers between 2022 and 2024.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Looking specifically at occupations considered to be at high
or moderate risk from generative AI, some graduate roles such as graphic
designers and management analysts have thousands fewer workers aged between 20
and 24 than in the year ChatGPT launched. The drop is also noticeable in some
highly exposed occupations that are not so popular with graduates, such as
insurance claim assessors, credit counsellors and loan interviewers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But in other graduate sectors, such as accountants and
auditors, youth employment was booming as of last year, according to US
government statistics — and this holds for many tech sector roles, despite a 2
per cent decline in young people employed in software development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other US government data to June 2025 shows that a recent
rise in unemployment among young men with college degrees was concentrated in
manual sectors such as construction and production, rather than white-collar
occupations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David Autor, professor of economics at MIT, said political
turmoil in the US, including whipsawing tariffs, the government slashing its
contracts with big consulting firms and cuts by the so-called Department of
Government Efficiency (Doge) to scientists and federal workers, were probably
having more impact than new technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Outside some specific occupations [such as] programmers, I
think it’s premature to ascribe recent labour market woes to AI,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karin Kimbrough, chief economist at the professional network
LinkedIn, argued that while new technology could play a role, the main driver
of a countrywide slowdown in entry-level hiring was the uncertainty over the
global economic outlook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Paramount... is the uncertain macroeconomic environment. We
know from our data that when hiring slows overall, entry level workers feel a
bigger impact,” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recruiters and other intermediaries said another factor was
companies stepping up offshoring as they sought to cut costs, and as the growth
of remote work made it possible to outsource more complex tasks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Most corporates are in a space where offshoring comes
before AI,” said Neil Carberry, chief executive of the UK’s Recruitment &amp;
Employment Confederation, whose members are seeing businesses move call centre
jobs abroad in tandem with the deployment of chatbots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kimbrough added that entry-level hiring remained strong in
developing economies such as Brazil, Mexico and India.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>None of this is likely to reassure graduates under pressure
to adopt AI as they enter a workforce where career structures are in flux. Kyle
Tan, the 24-year-old founder of Headstart, a UK agency placing student interns
with start-ups, said the arrival of AI in a weak economic environment had
created “a kind of superstorm” where employers would train fewer graduates and
expect more of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others take a more optimistic line, arguing that graduates
who have grown up with ChatGPT are well placed to make the most of the new
tools and bring new skills to employers. Micha Kaufman, founder of the
freelancing platform Fiverr, said Gen Z was driving a surge in UK-based
freelancers advertising on the site, which could reflect fewer permanent roles.
But he noted that young people were “actively in demand because they are AI
natives, meaning they are using AI to compensate for their lack of experience.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From a client perspective, “you get someone who is not super
expensive — and they can already produce more,” he claimed. “There is a case to
say that entry level [professionals] are actually going to be in higher
demand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some economists warn it is still too early to measure AI’s
labour market effects. “We should be wary of dramatic headlines about AI’s
impact on hiring,” said Nash of the IFOW. “Not only because it is very hard to
parse this from other drivers but also because ‘AI hype’ can itself become a
self-generating problem as people think that ‘this is what other businesses are
doing.’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Auterion to ship 33,000 AI drone kits to Ukraine</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>US-German software company Auterion will send tens of
thousands of its artificial intelligence drone &quot;strike kits&quot; to
Ukraine to help it combat mass attacks by Russian drones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lorenz Meier, Auterion chief executive, said the company
would ship 33,000 of its AI strike systems to Ukraine before the end of the
year under a new contract with the US Pentagon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The company's software is already being used in Ukrainian
drones operating combat missions against Russia, but the new commitment, Meier
told the Financial Times, was &quot;10 times in scale&quot;. &quot;So we've
shipped thousands and we're now shipping tens of thousands,&quot; he said,
adding that the scale was &quot;unprecedented&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Russia's air campaign has escalated in recent weeks, with
hundreds of Iranian-designed Shahed attack drones used in each strike. A single
bombardment now frequently surpasses the number of drones previously launched
over the course of a month. Major cities are being targeted with increased
frequency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The swarm tactics are also breaching Ukraine's air defences
more often, with strikes hitting targets at roughly three times the usual rate
in recent months, according to official data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Auterion's &quot;strike kits&quot; — miniature computers
known as Skynode that run the company's software and include a camera and radio
— can transform manually controlled drones into &quot;AI-powered weapons
systems&quot; that cannot be jammed and can track a moving target from as far
away as 1km, said Meier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The commitment comes after Auterion, which is headquartered
in Virginia in the US, secured a contract worth close to $50mn from the
Pentagon to deliver the systems. The contract is part of the US government's
security assistance to Ukraine, said Meier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was not part of a drone &quot;mega-deal&quot; that
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this month said he was discussing with
his US counterpart Donald Trump, with the aim of boosting industrial
co-operation between the two countries. But Meier said that his company had
&quot;pioneered&quot; US-Ukrainian co-production.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's basically acknowledging that the battle-hardening
that has happened in Ukraine of drone products is relevant. That it's a way to
support Ukraine, but it's also technology that... Nato countries want to get
their hands on.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meier said he expected further deals for Auterion software
with European countries. The company also has offices in Munich. Auterion's
software, said Meier, would enable the &quot;next evolution in warfare&quot;,
allowing swarms of autonomous drones to communicate with each other. &quot;What
we are providing is leapfrogging what's on the battlefield right now, which is
to go to AI-based targeting and swarming.&quot; Humans would always select the
targets, though, he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The company has sprung a surprise with the anarchic Bananza
game for Switch 2 — but does it justify buying the new console? By Tom Faber</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A number of times in the two months since I got my Switch 2,
I've turned the console on, still buzzing with the excitement of a new toy,
clicked around the menus for a while, and then turned it off again. I couldn't
find anything exciting to play.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s common for new consoles to feel a little thin in terms
of games for their first year or two, but even by the industry’s meagre
standards, the Switch 2’s launch line-up was weak. It had one appealing
exclusive in Mario Kart World, which is fun for racing a few laps with friends
but doesn't invite long, deep sessions of play.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nor does the console offer a thrill in its hardware.
Nintendo has a reputation for thinking outside the box with playful hardware
innovations (such as the Wii's motion controls or the Switch’s TV/handheld
hybrid design), but the Switch 2 is a machine whose improvements feel
incremental rather than revolutionary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what is there to feel excited about? And for those on the
fence, is it worth buying the new console yet?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nintendo’s answer to both of these questions has just
smashed through the wall in the form of Donkey Kong Bananza, a new game with
the Switch 2’s fortunes riding on its muscular, simian shoulders. It’s a 3D
platformer, a genre staple for the company, but also a surprise in that it
stars Donkey Kong, a B-tier Nintendo mascot, rather than a leading man such as
Mario or Link. As if to allay concerns, the normally tight-lipped Nintendo made
the unusual move of revealing who at the company was responsible for making the
game — the same team that made 2017’s Super Mario Odyssey, which set a modern
standard for the genre.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The DNA of Odyssey is abundantly clear in Bananza’s basic
formula. As Donkey Kong, you traverse large open worlds seeking hidden crystal
bananas, sometimes diving through portals for linear combat and platforming
challenges. The world design shows the developers firing on all cylinders, with
each space overflowing with clever secrets, beautiful details and stunning
vistas. Nintendo truly is gaming’s answer to golden-era Pixar — no other studio
is operating at this level of inspired, family-friendly game design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each of Nintendo’s banner 3D platformers has a central
gimmick, from the water jets of Super Mario Sunshine to the gravity-warping
planets of Super Mario Galaxy, and it’s here that the choice of Donkey Kong, a
character whose fists are larger than his brain, makes sense — Bananza is all
about destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whereas a Mario game has you balletically running and
jumping around a carefully sculpted environment, in Bananza you can just smash
through to the other side. Punch through mountains, pummel your way underground
and giddily terraform however you see fit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you progress through lush forests, alien moonscapes and
sunset canyons, you learn to use your destructive capabilities tactically. The
game encourages players to pay attention to the materiality of its world — each
area of the landscape has its own properties and hardness, from volcanic lava
to poisonous swamps, and you must combine these strategically to defeat enemies
and progress. Later you gain access to special animal transformations, the
titular “Bananzas”, which allow you to sprint, fly and — of course — punch even
harder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something about smashing through these beautiful landscapes
feels gloriously anarchic, and while Nintendo isn't the first to do it —
there’s Minecraft, and the smart demolition puzzler Teardown — it’s still a
surprise that a company known for tight control and careful design is willing
to give the player so much agency to deform terrain and reshape its game
worlds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this is the new direction Nintendo embarked upon in
recent Zelda games, encouraging creative problem solving in Breath of the Wild
and Tears of the Kingdom. Whatever the player wants to do, the game tries to
say yes, allowing for a high degree of chaos and unpredictability without ever
breaking — an impressive technical feat. Bananza wholly satisfies two divergent
but primal gamer desires: to feel clever, and to smash things. What more could
you want?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a couple of months with my Switch 2, I've warmed to
the console. Although little about its design feels novel, the hardware boasts
dozens of small, thoughtful improvements that make it feel like a sleek,
grown-up gaming device, compared to which the original resembles a plastic toy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These include more ergonomic Joy-Con controllers which snap
into place with satisfying magnets, and a larger screen which is better suited
to multiplayer sessions on the go. Then there’s the increased processing power
which means that games whose frame-rates struggled on the original Switch, such
as Fortnite or recent Pokémon and Zelda titles, now run as smooth as butter.
The Switch 2 makes most sense if you look at it like a phone upgrade — it’s
still a Switch, just better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are other decent games to play, too. Mario Kart World
does not move the needle significantly since the excellent Mario Kart 8, but
it’s still a great lark, with races now handling 24 players and a new knockout
mode where four players are eliminated each lap until only the best remain to
fight for gold. Super Mario Party Jamboree is another multiplayer offering with
new minigames utilising the console’s camera and mouse control capabilities,
hardware additions which have so far yet to prove themselves. A number of
quality third-party games also have Switch 2 releases, including Cyberpunk
2077, Hitman: World of Assassination and Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut, alongside
strong indies such as Deltarune and No Man's Sky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The received wisdom with new console releases is to wait a
couple of years for a good library of games to be established before investing
in the hardware (the hardcore fans will buy on day one anyway — they already
made the Switch 2 the fastest-selling console in US history). Donkey Kong
Bananza is undoubtedly the first great game for the Switch 2, but it isn’t
quite enough to justify the purchase of a new console alone. Plus, Nintendo’s
upcoming release schedule looks murky. The only exciting game on the horizon is
sci-fi shooter Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, but the company might have something
else up its sleeve for the holiday season.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One quality that continues to set Nintendo apart from its
rivals is that it still puts a lot of stock in console-exclusive games. As
Microsoft and Sony move towards a hardware-agnostic position, allowing players
to access their games on a variety of devices, Nintendo still doggedly insists
that you can only play Nintendo games on a Nintendo console.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘Bananza satisfies two primal gamer desires: to feel clever,
and to smash things’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For this reason alone, fans of the company’s unique approach
to game design will want to invest in a Switch 2 at some point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Donkey Kong Bananza teaches us something else, too — that
Nintendo hasn't forgotten what it does best. It might have played it unusually
safe with the design of the new console, but this boldly strange game shows
that it plans to continue trying to surprise as well as delight, to maintain
its reputation as a company that always finds unexpected new ways to deliver
joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each morning, Christos Papapetrou looks to the sky. “We all
do,” says the head of Cyprus’s farmers’ union. “We're hoping for clouds, for
rain.” But as their island enters a third consecutive year of drought, there is
little sign of either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This summer, for the first time in recent memory, Cyprus
will be forced to import tomatoes, watermelons and other produce it has long
grown, because farmers cannot irrigate. The government has halved agricultural
water allocations, cutting off seasonal crops entirely. “We’ve accepted it,”
Papapetrou says. “But let’s not pretend this is just a farmers’ problem. It
affects the whole country. Prices will soar.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As climate change makes rains more erratic and groundwater
sources run low, governments across the world are seeking solutions to keep the
taps running — a boon for the fast-growing desalination industry, which market
researchers think will exceed $20bn in 2027. In 2024, it was estimated at less
than $15bn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Cyprus, years of under-investment, fragmented
policymaking and reliance on rainfall have brought the water system close to
collapse. As of early June, the country’s 18 main reservoirs were just 21.7 per
cent full. Five years ago, that figure was 97 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Doubling down on energy-intensive desalination is now seen
as the only viable option. Cyprus already has four large-scale desalination
plants that it operates during water scarcity. Maria Panayiotou, the country’s
agriculture minister, has made desalination the centrepiece of a 28-point
emergency water plan, aiming to meet all of Cyprus’s drinking water needs
through desalination within two to three years by operating the units
continuously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The southern European state is just one country in a
widening water-stressed zone, loosely encircling the globe from India across to
North America, with parts of the Pacific and southern Africa also affected. An
estimated one in 10 people now lives in a country with what the UN’s water
agency classifies as “high and critical water stress.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As populations and economies grow, “societies are becoming
thirstier and thirstier”, says Kaveh Madani, director of the UN University
Institute for Water, Environment and Health. “We have limited renewable water
supplies that are now becoming even more limited than before thanks to climate
change.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘Now we're even thinking about desalinating and transferring
water for 800km. This is how desperate people are.’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The desalination process has improved drastically in recent
decades, finally pulling away from the ancient technique of boiling seawater to
more sophisticated technology, reverse osmosis, that uses microscopic pores in
specially designed membranes to filter out salt. Professor Nidal Hilal,
director of the Water Research Center at New York University Abu Dhabi,
estimates that global growth in desalination capacity is between 6 and 12 per
cent annually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But both the older thermal technique and the newer version
have the same problems: they require large amounts of energy to power the
plants, and the process produces pollution in the form of ultra salty water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, with demand rising, companies and governments from the
Middle East and beyond are ploughing billions into scaling up the desalination
infrastructure needed in a warmer, drier world, while wrestling with the
technology’s unpalatable side-effects. “It produces a lot of brine. It affects
the ecosystem. Significantly,” says Madani.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet for some countries, desalination is the only answer.
“Now we're even thinking about desalinating and transferring water ... like
transferring water for 800km,” he adds. “It sounds crazy, but this is how
desperate people are.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The driving force behind desalination’s modernisation are
the communities around the Gulf, whose existence depends on the process. The
oil-rich Gulf state of Kuwait, which has no permanent rivers and was once
forced to ship freshwater in from neighbouring Iraq, pioneered the technology
in the Middle East by commissioning its first desalination plant in 1951.
Similarly parched neighbours quickly followed suit. Today the arid Middle East
and North Africa region accounts for about 70 per cent of global desalination
capacity, according to the EU Blue Economy Observatory. The region’s largest
plants can produce enough water to supply more than 1 million people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Below the undulating surface of the Arabian Sea, thousands
of cubic metres of water flow into pipes tall enough for a person to stand up
in, running over a kilometre back to Oman’s biggest desalination plant, Barka
IV, which uses reverse osmosis. Getting the seawater into the plant is
difficult. It has to be siphoned gently, to avoid drawing in sea creatures. A
wall of bubbles billows around the intake pipes to ward off jellyfish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The salty water that flows into tanks is green with algae,
which must be pushed to the surface using air bubbles, creating a sludgy carpet
that can be skimmed off before filtration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This pre-treatment must be completed before the water is
pushed at high pressure through delicate membranes. After that, minerals are
added to the pure water. The leftover super-salty brine is diffused back into
the sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sea in the Gulf is “the hardest water to desalinate on
the planet,” according to Hilal of NYU Abu Dhabi. The semi-enclosed Gulf is
much saltier than larger, more open bodies of water. And “the higher the salt
concentration, the more energy is required for desalination,” Hilal says,
adding that the situation is aggravated by the water's high “turbidity” or
cloudiness, due to the sea’s shipping routes and the presence of wastewater.</p>

</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reverse osmosis — if pressure is applied to the solution,
the flow can be forced to reverse; this is useful in desalination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sources: Tampa Bay Water</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The industry has attempted to reduce energy consumption by
switching to reverse osmosis, like at Barka IV, which is far less intensive.
“It’s around a fourth, or a fifth even, of the energy required for the thermal
desalination technology,” explains Hilal. “The membrane technology has
developed a lot and we are still, in my opinion, on the surface of it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reducing energy consumption has made producing desalinated
water less polluting in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced the
costs. In Israel, water produced by the Sorek B desalination plant is priced at
about 40 cents per cubic metre, which is enough for 25 showers, according to
Thames Water. Dubai utility Dewa will get a price of 37 cents per cubic metre
for water from its Hassyan desalination plant, which is due to start operations
next year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We've put a lot of money in R&amp;D... to be able to reduce
this energy consumption,&quot; says Estelle Brachlianoff, chief executive
officer of energy and water company Veolia. “We've divided [the cost] by five
in the last 12 years.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The €22.4bn French multinational is one of the utility and
engineering companies profiting from the world’s increasing water fragility.
The company says 18 per cent of global desalination capacity already runs on
its technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Academic researchers are focusing on improving the membranes
by looking for materials and techniques to prevent them getting clogged up with
residue, which shortens their lifespans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there are hopes reverse osmosis desalination can be made
even more energy efficient. In the US, so-called deep-sea desalination is being
piloted, using the pressure of the ocean itself to push seawater through the
membranes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the benefits of cheaper desalination are not enjoyed by
all. Cyprus is using reverse osmosis but imports fossil fuels to power it,
meaning each cubic metre costs €1.50 to produce — almost five times as much as
the new Hassyan plant in Dubai.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The government plans to retrofit pumping stations with solar
panels, but space on the island is limited and its grid lacks the storage
capacity to support more water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Desalination can’t run in fits and starts,” Panayiota
Hadjigeorgiou, former head of the water development department, says. “It needs
reliable power.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gulf is still reliant on the older technology, which has
a long lifespan. Dubai, the Arab Gulf’s second-biggest city by population after
Riyadh, gets 86 per cent of its desalinated water from thermal distillation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Companies in the region say they want to change this. Taga,
the Abu Dhabi utilities company that provides the city with desalinated water,
aims to have 66 per cent of its desalination capacity use reverse osmosis by
2030, up from 40 per cent today. It has also added 70 megawatts of solar power
to its vast Taweelah plant, which uses reverse osmosis, to reduce its use of
fossil fuels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s a priority for us that we be more efficient,” says
Taqa’s chief executive, Jasim Husain Thabet. “Therefore we are rolling out more
reverse osmosis” and eyeing other initiatives including reusing wastewater and
curbing losses from leaking pipes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even as emissions from desalination fall, there is the
intractable problem of brine, the ultra-salty substance left behind after pure
water is extracted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Desalination worldwide produces 150 million cubic metres of
brine per day, according to scientific research. This thick, milky liquid is
generally dumped back into the sea. One study has linked desalination brine
with coral bleaching in the Gulf of Aqaba and others have found impacts on
marine life on the sea bed around discharge points.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cyprus is particularly worried about brine’s impact on the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“For every cubic metre of freshwater, nearly half a cubic
metre of brine is discharged,” says Hadjigeorgiou. The island uses offshore
pipelines and diffusers to spread the brine up to 2km from the coast, away from
sensitive ecosystems, and “there’s no evidence of damage so far, but we must
stay vigilant,” she says.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the small, shallow Gulf, which feeds more than 800
desalination plants, jettisoning brine has led to concerns about rising salt
concentration and the impact on sensitive species.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There are challenges with brine discharge,” acknowledges
Taqa’s Thabet. “It’s not limited to us, it is an industry-wide problem that
needs a collective action.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Academics in Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest desalinated
water producer, are trying to tackle the brine problem. Zhiping Lai, a
professor at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, is mining
the brine for valuable elements. His team has published in the journal&nbsp;<i>Science</i>&nbsp;a
novel method for extracting lithium, which is used in making batteries, and Lai
has established a start-up to try to commercialise the new technique.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In principle if we could extract lithium from this brine,
it could enhance economic viability to solve this issue,” says Lai. Although
lithium is found in very low concentrations in brine, “the kingdom is willing
to spend efforts to solve this challenge.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With desalination such a high priority in the Gulf, Veolia
boss Brachlianoff says governments there have found successful models for
contracting and financing the projects. These are usually private-public
partnerships with “specific financing, specific take or pay models from the
customer”. She highlighted the UAE, which has awarded three projects to Veolia
in recent years, all through private-public partnership models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Veolia says the Middle East market was its fastest growing
last year across its different services. “Water technologies is one of its
fastest-growing services worldwide, with reported sales of nearly €5bn last
year.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Middle East “was always aware that water was something
absolutely needed for industry. So we have desalination plants to serve
refineries in the Middle East, not only to serve the population or to serve
industries,” says Brachlianoff. “This realisation that you need water for
everything, of course, [is one on] which Europe is quite behind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Veolia has plenty of multinational competitors. Spain’s
Acciona, whose water division had 2024 revenues of €1.2bn, has contracts to run
desalination plants from Perth, Australia, to Qatar and a market capitalisation
of €9.3bn. South Korea’s Doosan Enerbility also operates desalination
facilities across the Gulf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Middle Eastern infrastructure builders are also looking to
export their desalination expertise. Riyadh-listed ACWA Power is the region’s
biggest power and water developer. It says it controls more than a quarter of
the desalinated water in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman and Bahrain. “We are now
looking abroad [beyond the Gulf],” says Marco Arcelli, chief executive. “We
hope to be signing soon agreements in Azerbaijan, Senegal. We're looking at
projects in China, in Malaysia, in the Philippines.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet some experts warn that desalination, while profitable
for companies, is far from the sole solution to water shortages. Countries are
also investing in improving water infrastructure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The European Investment Bank, for example, lent some €400m
to water projects in Spain last year, which paid for the renovation or
installation of 2,000km worth of pipes. Between 2023 and 2024, the
drought-affected state of California spent $63m on water recycling, capture and
storage projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We have the commercial system and we have the desperate
governments on the other side,” says Madani, the UN University official. “It’s
much easier to increase supply than cut consumption.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He adds that reducing water use and harnessing wastewater
are also critical. “Desalination can play and will play a major role… But it’s
not the solution. That means building the biggest desalination plant in your
country is not necessarily something to celebrate.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>China’s battle with deflation isn’t just a demand problem</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beijing's policies have encouraged overproduction and
excessive competition</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China shows no sign of securing lasting victory in its
battle with deflation. Although annual consumer price inflation turned positive
in June — for the first time since January — there are few who believe that
sustained price growth is returning. A lack of demand remains a problem.
Beijing has made a few efforts to encourage consumers, but it will need to go
further, including by bolstering the country’s patchy benefit and pension
provisions, which incentivise precautionary savings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Either way, there is little hope of China beating
deflationary dynamics unless the Chinese Communist party addresses the other
side of the ledger too — that of excessive supply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Annual growth in producer prices has been negative since
October 2022. Limited appetite among consumers at home forces Chinese factories
to keep prices down in order to grab as much market share as possible. But low
prices in China’s supply chains are also the inevitable consequence of
aggressive competition in traditional industries such as steel and cement, and
modern ones, including electric vehicles, solar panels and artificial
intelligence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After initially denying foreign concerns about overcapacity,
Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leading officials have attacked domestic
manufacturers for what they call <i>neijuan</i>, or “involution” which, when
applied to industry, alludes to excessive price competition. Beijing’s own
policies are largely to blame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over recent years, the president has reiterated the
importance of “new quality productive forces” to China’s economic progress. The
strategy emphasises the development of advanced technologies and new
industries. This is triggering a free for all in the country’s state-led
capitalist model. Businesses clamber into new industries to attract political
support and prestige. Local governments — with their own economic targets,
handed down from the centre — then tend to shower emerging industries with
subsidies, tax breaks and protections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the result is a surge in investment, rife with
duplication. Factories and production lines are often established with little
regard for downstream demand. As stock piles up, retail prices get slashed —
sometimes below cost — as producers try to maintain their market share. Ports
are turned into EV car parks, and AI chips lie idle in newly constructed data
centres.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is getting harder for Chinese manufacturers to export
this oversupply. Its trading partners now have heightened awareness of the
impact of importing cheap products on their domestic industries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beijing is trying to pressure provincial politicians and
industries to clamp down on “involution”. The cement, steel and construction
sectors have all suggested they will make adjustments. Controlling
hyper-competitive industries, however, will not be straightforward without
significant reforms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The state’s largesse needs to be curbed; a unified national
market might help restrain local governments’ ability to offer distorting
incentives. Shifting provincial targets away from GDP would alleviate the
narrow focus on output. Tighter intellectual property frameworks could slash
duplication and encourage more innovative differentiation. In other words,
Beijing needs to nurture the conditions for freer and fairer competition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s possible that Xi focuses on setting caps and pressuring
producers to reduce output. He may be conscious of overcorrecting since he has
made modern manufacturing the central pillar of China’s growth model. But
Beijing will do well to realise that its excessive support is the problem. The
state can build factories — but it can’t manufacture efficiency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The Very Online Right has come for Britain too</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jemina Kelly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as I heard the opening line, spoken — in a
serious-newsreader voice — over a piece of generic classical library music and
drone footage of some random hills, I knew it was going to be bad: “Britain. An
ancient place.” But I don't think I realised quite how bad GB News’s “Yookay vs
Britain: How immigration transformed a nation” documentary was going to get.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was to be a “deep dive into Britain’s exponential
change in the face of uncontrolled mass migration”, we are told. “At the turn
of the millennium, Britain took a radical new path on immigration . . . was
Britain ready for this?” the blurb reads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The funny thing was, that question is never addressed. The
majority of the first half of the documentary focuses on the violence of UK
“drill” music, during which we are shown extensive interviews with two
British-born musicians. The rest largely consists of some pretty transparent
race-baiting and non sequiturs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This is a story about immigration,” the presenter Steven
Edginton tells us in his voiceover, as we are shown footage of a Black woman
being asked what it means to be British. “It means that although I’m British
and I’m born in this country, that I'm still rejected as a Black person,” she
replies. “Welcome to the yookay,” he continues, as if she somehow represented
something we are to think of as abhorrent, while we’re shown footage of various
ethnic minorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “yookay” is a reference to “Yookay Aesthetics”, a
satirical account on X devoted to “chronicling the new Britain AKA ‘the
Yookay’”. It posts images of multicultural Britain — halal butchers, Deliveroo
riders and shops with foreign names all feature. Posts from recent days include
one captioned “Indian man showers in River Thames” (showing a fully dressed man
with his feet in the water) and a notice about a proposed new mosque in Dover.
“Aesthetics account — posts are not implicit value judgments”, the account’s
bio reads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similarly, the documentary never actually says anything
explicitly racist. Instead, it shows us a series of vox pops with people in the
streets of Brixton — four Black, two white — who are asked about British values
and to give their opinions on “Great British heroes” like Alfred the Great,
Lord Nelson and, er, Henry VIII.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But one of the vox pops didn’t go down quite the way GB News
might have hoped. It showed a young, British-born Black man explaining why he
loves Britain but then struggling to respond to what he considers to be British
values — “is it something to do with the cost of living or something?” he asks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’ve plastered this video all over your social media
channels, taking advantage of my autistic older brother for views and to push
your weird anti-black narrative,” his brother posted on X in response to the
clip. “As a news company that <i>should</i> be responsible, this shouldn’t have
been posted but oh well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quite. And I wasn’t the only one to agree. Among those to
call out GB News were one of their own presenters, Martin Daubney, who asked,
“How many white kids would know about Alfred the Great?” (not to mention
adults), and the former leader of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson,
who deemed it “a liberty” (i.e., out of order) and said the interviewee was
“not a problem”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is an astonishing demonstration of the broader cultural
and political shift to the right — not to the traditional, conservative right
but to the far more “based”, vice-signalling, Very Online right — that GB News,
a channel that claims to stand for “the Great British culture of honour”
thought it could get away with this kind of nasty, low-quality content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of this shift is about a backlash to the censoriousness
and identity politics that has dominated culture for several years and that
peaked in 2020. But it is also a product of the fragmentation of the internet
into a series of homogenous silos, particularly since Elon Musk’s takeover of
what was then Twitter — and the mass X-odus of liberals, primarily to Bluesky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spend any time on X and the algorithms will rapidly serve
you up a whole slew of content aimed at stirring up hatred — often along racial
or religious lines. It is a depressing experience. And the problem is that
precisely because of how awful so much of it is, those who consider it as such
aren’t around to call it out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems unthinkable to me that this “documentary” would
have come out even three years ago; the nastiest part of the right has become
hugely emboldened. And while these might be new online echo chambers, what they
are peddling is simply old-fashioned racism and bigotry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What the world got wrong about tariffs Extract</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the beginning of the year, the world was in striking
agreement on one point: if Donald Trump went ahead with tariffs, it would
strengthen the dollar and trigger stagflation. Chief executives, investors and
commentators all said the same. Economists estimated that every percentage
point increase in the tariff rate would shave 0.1 per cent off US growth and
add 0.1 per cent to inflation. But so far, the consequences have been far less
disruptive than just about anyone expected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some analysts still think that’s because Trump’s threats
have been mostly posturing. But the effective US tariff rate has already risen
from 2.5 per cent to 15 per cent. Tariff revenue is rolling in at an annual
rate above $300bn, roughly four times the pace this time last year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many economists had assumed that, by lowering imports,
tariffs would strengthen the dollar almost automatically, as an accounting
identity. Instead, it suffered its worst fall over the first half of a year
since the early 1970s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This unexpected turn is now attributed to the fact that the
dollar started the year historically overvalued. Many foreigners were heavily
exposed to dollar assets. Of late, they have been hedging those risks and
investing more outside the US. Many countries are increasingly attractive
places to park money, in part because tariff threats inspired them to push
economic reform and cut trade deals with non-US partners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bigger mystery is why the stagflationary impact of
tariffs has yet to materialise in the aggregate data. Is the US really enjoying
a free lunch, taking in $300bn a year in tariff revenues with none of the
expected heartburn? By some estimates, foreign exporters are indeed absorbing
20 per cent of the costs — a much larger share than they did in response to
tariffs in Trump’s first term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The remaining 80 per cent, however, is still getting paid in
roughly equal shares by US corporations and consumers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The likely answer is that the negative economic effect of
tariffs is being countered by other forces, including the mania for artificial
intelligence and more government stimulus. Since January, estimates of what the
big tech companies will spend this year on building out AI infrastructure have
risen $60bn to $350bn. Smaller businesses are scrambling to catch the wave too,
further boosting growth. And all this excitement is neutralising the fear that
trade policy uncertainty would dampen animal spirits and freeze new capex.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>AI-driven bullishness is also lifting growth by keeping
financial conditions loose, even with higher interest rates. According to a new
index from the Federal Reserve, those conditions would be neutral, not loose,
were it not for the stock market, which has continued rising this year due
largely to AI stocks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, the promise of tax relief makes it easier for US
corporations to absorb a larger than expected share of the tariff costs, rather
than pass it all on to consumers. Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is expected to
save US businesses around $100bn this year and more than that in 2026, mainly
in tax breaks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is not to say tariffs have no negative economic effect.
The costs are in fact starting to show up in higher prices for major household
appliances, sporting goods and toys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet the overall inflation rate has been held in check by
falling rents and prices for other kinds of goods, including used cars and
energy. And those prices are declining for reasons unrelated to tariffs;
used-car prices are still retreating from highs created by supply disruptions
during the pandemic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So economists were not entirely wrong about the tariffs. And
stagflation may yet materialise, particularly if the average effective rate
continues to climb. But so far even a much higher rate has not been enough to
overwhelm the larger forces sustaining growth and containing inflation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a way what we are seeing is a replay of 2023. That year,
too, many expected a big shock (then mainly from Fed rate rises) to
dramatically slow US growth, only to find the impact offset by the AI spending
boom and the US government’s seemingly bottomless capacity to keep doling out
fiscal support.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What the world got wrong, then and now, starts with its
mental frameworks. The timeworn mistake of employing simple models, in which a
headline-grabbing input A leads in a straight line to outcome B, has been
greatly magnified by the global obsession with Trump. He is the only input
anyone cares to analyse anymore. But complex economies are rarely shaped by
just one factor, not even a shock as big as Trump’s trade policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The coming cryptocurrency CTISIS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=411 src="FT_files/image021.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My heart sank last week when I read that JPMorgan Chase was
looking into lending against clients’ cryptocurrency holdings, even though we
all knew the day was coming when crypto would make its way into the real
economy. Bitcoin, one of the digital assets banks may lend against, has been
nearly four times as volatile as major indices since 2020. It has also had ties
to terror funding, and I have yet to read anything that made me think it is
more than a tool for speculators and criminals. But that hardly matters when
the largest political donors are behind it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crypto political action committees have, over the last
several years, spent tens of millions of dollars donating to not only
Republican politicians but many Democrats too. This effort culminated a couple
of weeks ago in the passage of the Genius Act. Legislation covering other
crypto assets is expected later this year. I predict all this will not only
cause the next financial crisis, but fuel even more political populism and
unrest in the US.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s all too reminiscent of 2000, when advocates for
over-the-counter derivatives descended on Washington begging to be properly
“regulated” so that they could gift the world with financial “innovation.” What
we got instead was a seven-fold increase in poorly regulated credit default
swaps that culminated in the great financial crisis of 2008.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now consider that US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent
expects the stablecoin market to grow tenfold over the next few years, from a
near-$200bn to a $2tn industry, one that will be embedded in everything from
loan underwriting to Treasury markets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Democrat Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the
Senate banking commission, told me last week: “We’ve seen this movie before,”
with lobbyists “saying, ‘Please regulate us’ because they want the gold sticker
of government confirmation that they are a ‘safe’ investment,” and politicians
offering up bipartisan support for deregulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, you can draw a clear line from derivatives
deregulation in 2000, and the broader Clinton era deregulation that eroded the
barriers between trading and lending, to the weakening of Dodd Frank regulation
for regional banks in 2018 (which contributed to the banking crisis of 2023),
and now, the Genius Act. All of it was bipartisan. Warren, who was brought to
power by voters who felt betrayed by mainstream politicians of both stripes,
waged an unsuccessful campaign to convince Democrats not to go along with
Republican support for the Genius Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But money talks, and the crypto lobby has already shown
tremendous power by spending $40mn to defeat critics like Sherrod Brown of
Ohio, the former Senate Banking chair. While almost two-thirds of Senate
Democrats voted against the Genius Act, the proponents—including influential
Democratic senators like Virginia's Mark Warner and New York’s Kirsten
Gillibrand—were enough for the legislation to pass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This worries me for four reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, the Genius Act (like the Commodity Futures
Modernization Act of 2000) is being marketed as a way to make crypto safer,
with stablecoins backed one to one by US dollars. But that doesn’t make what
is, more broadly, a volatile asset class any less volatile. Indeed, it may only
make the overall market more so. Advocates talk about cryptocurrencies such as
bitcoin as a hedge against traditional markets, but in fact, bitcoin is a “high
beta” investment, meaning that it is highly correlated to the stock market.
That means that both gains and losses relative to the S&amp;P are amplified.
Anything over a beta of one indicates a higher volatility than the market. A
recent Fidelity report found bitcoin’s rolling 3-year beta to the S&amp;P was
2.6.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, I can’t imagine a worse moment to encourage
financial “innovation” than when markets, economics and monetary policy are so
uncertain. Consider what could happen if, over the coming months or years, the
Fed must raise interest rates more sharply due to inflation. Markets would
tank, as they always do when rates go up. Crypto would fall further and faster.
Financial institutions (including any number of shadow banks) holding crypto on
their balance sheets could then run into trouble, causing credit markets to
freeze. Suddenly, we're facing echoes of 2008.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enter my third worry. Genius Act proponents say it will
support the dollar and the Treasury market. But one could easily imagine a
flight to safety into which crypto companies like, say, Tether (which has more
US Treasury holdings than Germany) must sell T-bills into a down market to
cover redemptions. Then you’ve got a fire sale, higher borrowing costs, and yet
another disastrous situation in which Main Street is under pressure to bail out
speculators.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this time, it comes after more than two decades of
growing cynicism with politics. This gets me to my final worry. Financial
deregulation from the late 1990s under the Clinton administration set the stage
for both 2008 and a loss of working people’s support for Democrats. That in
turn set the stage for Trump’s rise. Trump has now set the stage for our next
financial crisis by backing (and of course, trading) crypto. What happens when
we get financial chaos and more voter cynicism about mainstream politics at a
time when there is less interest or ability for the government to buffer a
downturn? No coin, and nothing stable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The answer to UK stagnation IS Staring us in the face</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we are told on a daily if not hourly basis, the source of
all our political, public service and economic woes is the lack of economic
growth. The economic potential of the majority of the British people who don’t
live in Greater London is overlooked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 2008 financial crisis hit the UK particularly hard
because our economy was so centred on finance. The Conservatives responded with
the economic equivalent of leeches — sustained austerity. The result has been
the slow strangulation of the economy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under these profound policy mistakes lies a multi-decade
failure to foster geographically even economic growth. From a productivity and
GDP per head perspective we are two nations: Greater London and the Southeast,
and everywhere else. This means there is a huge opportunity to improve
productivity and output. Even small increases in productivity beyond London and
the Southeast would break the stranglehold of stagnation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GDP per head in the UK averages just over £39,000. Every
region is below that except the Southeast at £41,000 and London at a whopping
£69,000. My region, the Northeast, is the lowest at £28,000, despite having
world-leading companies and research institutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We see the same disparities when we look at labour
productivity, which is also indirectly a measure of capital investment both
physical and human. At 86 per cent of the national average per head, the
Northeast’s has barely changed in two decades. If we could just lift that GDP
to the national average it would increase UK GDP by 1.14 per cent — almost the
same GDP growth for the entire country in 2024. If we could do the same for the
next lowest region — Wales — that would add a further 1.2 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That picture is reflected across the country. If the Tories
had matched their talk of levelling up with action on regional productivity and
per capita GDP we could have had healthy economic growth for every year but the
Covid year of 2020 and 2023, which followed Liz Truss’s economic disruption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are some hard truths embedded in this data. First, a
London-centred approach to economic policy cannot bring back healthy growth for
the nation. Second, the gross inequality in economic output is a consequence of
decades of under-investment elsewhere and can only be addressed by smart
strategic investment and effective public-private co-operation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, investment has to mean science and technology. In our
enquiry into regional innovation and growth, the select committee has taken
wide-ranging evidence. From the education and skilling of the workforce, to
technology and capital deployment in businesses, start ups and spin outs, to
lab facilities and “catapult” tech centres, to internet and transport
connectivity, disparities need to be addressed. That means building on the
existing business and technology strengths of the diverse regions, and, in particular,
mayors. Working with regional governments must take up this agenda. And it must
begin with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology — but not end
there. Lifting productivity must be a co-ordinated project across government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Labour has inherited a destructive legacy of stagnation and
regional underdevelopment. It has made some, limited, progress, increasing
investment in science and transport and extending devolution. Unfortunately, my
committee’s work has also revealed an enduring complacency and lack of regional
lens in many Whitehall departments. If that parochialism is left undisturbed we
will remain two countries when it comes to productivity and output — suffering
economic stagnation while staring at the solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The truly scary thing about the Coldplay concert scandal</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=429 src="FT_files/image022.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You know what’s really interesting about this Coldplay
couple story,’ a colleague said to me the other day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I very much doubted I would know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were speaking nearly a week after Andy Byron, the chief
executive of tech company Astronomer, was caught on a giant video screen at a
Coldplay concert in Boston with his arms around a woman who was a) his head of
HR and b) not his wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Byron had by then been a top-trending Google topic from
Australia to Albania and it seemed unlikely there was anything compelling left
to say about him. But my colleague made a good point: for those of us who deal
with the vast corporate PR industrial complex, it was notable to watch a top
executive fall so comprehensively that no amount of fudging obfuscation could
save him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That would make it unusual in a world where media enquiries
about corporate impropriety, no matter how well based, are often met with a “no
comment’, a huffy denial or a threat of legal action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s been like this for years, as a lay-off strewn news
industry continues to confront a far more buoyant public relations sector. In
the US alone there were nearly five PR people for every journalist in 2013 and
by some counts, the ratio has since widened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are, of course, a lot of decent PR professionals and
yes, journalists have long been among the least trusted people. Though a 2024
global survey does suggest we are doing better than politicians and are level
with bankers and, as it happens, business leaders. This improvement is welcome
because the Coldplay affair underlines another critical point: the need for
robust journalism in an age of rampant and grimly effective fake social media
“news”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the most notable aspects of the incident was the
spread of fabricated online statements purporting to be from those involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contrary to what you might have read (and may still
believe), Byron did not say he found it troubling that “what should have been a
private moment became public without my consent”. His wife did not post a
tearful statement about the scandal. Coldplay did not say it would now have
camera-free audience sections for people and their “sidepieces”. And the
red-faced woman filmed standing next to the couple was not another Astronomer
employee named Alyssa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This avalanche of online tripe was so gigantic that
Astronomer had to address it head-on. “Alyssa Stoddard was not at the event and
no other employees were in the video,” it said in a statement. “Andy Byron has
not put out any statement, reports saying otherwise are all incorrect.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alas, this came too late for some newspapers, which reported
Byron’s statement as fact. On the upside, proper news outlets corrected the
error. But don’t expect that from the hoaxers, nor the social media sites that
hosted their nonsense. And here is the serious point. Coldplay-gate doubtless
caused hurt for those at the centre of it and their families. But so far, the
hoaxes it spurred have been relatively harmless compared with the plethora of
online scams that continue to go unchecked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just in the EU, the latest figures show internet fraudsters
swindled people out of €4.3bn in 2022. Since then there has been an explosion
of AI tools that help scammers make cheap and convincing fake videos of
financial experts to lure consumers into making dodgy investments or disclosing
data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Social media companies insist they remove adverts for this
rot and try to stay ahead of the fakers. But as my colleague Martin Wolf wrote
after discovering his identity had been faked, it is hard to believe tech
giants, with all their resources, cannot do better. The same goes for all the
other unfettered online harm. Some governments are trying to legislate, notably
in the EU. The Coldplay couple — and the misleading maelstrom that followed
their exposure — are a reminder more need to join them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Time for Britain to rethink aversion to the super-CEO</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=346 height=471 src="FT_files/image023.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HSBC is struggling to find a replacement for chair Mark
Tucker, pictured. A relatable problem, probably, to many British boards. BP
just named a new chair; Prudential seeks one too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finding the right balance of experience and availability can
be a real chore. Yet, if HSBC were based on the other side of the Atlantic,
there might be a simple solution: give the job to the chief executive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nothing provokes pearl-clutching among UK investors and
governance watchers as much as the idea of combining the chair and CEO roles.
It’s simply not the done thing. Shareholder advisory service ISS calls it “a
serious breach of good practice” given the chair’s importance in keeping the
chief in check.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The UK’s corporate governance code asks companies to comply
with the principle of separating the two jobs, or explain. Almost all comply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Americans aren't fully convinced. About two-fifths of
S&amp;P 500 companies combine the two roles, including six of the biggest 10 by
market capitalisation. And while the number is falling, shareholders still
don’t seem to care much. This year, companies fielded 31 proposals to split the
CEO and chair role, down from 44 in 2024, according to Freshfields. Not one
received majority support; the average vote was 31 per cent in favour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Supreme leaders are a recipe for misfortune. But separate
chairs aren't the only way to hold the CEO’s feet to the fire. JPMorgan, like
nearly two-thirds of S&amp;P 500 companies that combine the jobs according to
the Conference Board/ESGAUGE, argues this is the role of the lead independent
director, whose job is to act as a liaison for shareholders and generally check
the board is running as it ought to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having an independent chair is no guarantee of a
well-behaved CEO either, as Tesla has amply shown. Putting too much emphasis on
the chair risks turning down the volume on the other members of the board, who
ought to be acting collectively to keep the company on track.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Better to have directors who are, say, tasked with making
annual site visits and reporting back to the board than one strong personality
who provides much of the impetus while others nod along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now is a good time for the UK to question long-held views.
The pressure is on to attract companies lured by US markets, where valuations
are higher and governance rules more flexible. Good governance should always
command a premium, but the idea that splitting CEO and chair roles is
sufficient — or really necessary — deserves debate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>EU’s budget is setting it up for geopolitical
marginalisation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Earlier in July, the European Commission fired the starting
gun on a 30-month marathon negotiation on the EU’s next seven-year budget.
Brussels has proposed a nearly €2tn common spending pot it claims faces up to
Europe’s “new and emerging challenges”. Does it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, the good. Brussels has taken some steps towards
reallocating funds to today’s priorities: infrastructure, defence, security,
research and energy and industrial resilience. The exact numbers are already
the subject of fights, even inside the commission itself. But just as important
is the lack of controversy around the methodological changes to the budget.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The commission rolls agricultural subsidies and transfers to
poorer regions into new national plans, to be proposed by governments, approved
by the EU and checked against delivery to release funding. This marks a major
shift, modelled on the post-pandemic recovery fund. Grumbles can be heard about
insufficient funding and a power grab by national governments from local
officials. But not about the basic principle of cash in return for
demonstrable, mutually agreed reforms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is a quiet revolution from the habit of simply sending
checks to farmers and local governments; the most remarkable thing about the
budget draft was the least remarked upon. Another change seemingly received
without objection is the streamlining of the budget into fewer funding streams.
This simplification should speed up disbursement and ease planning and
co-ordination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, the bad. The commission has reprioritised its budget
with a view to the changing geopolitical landscape. The commission’s new
spending priorities show it has listened to warnings in the Enrico Letta and
Mario Draghi reports. But it has missed the opportunity to integrate budget
politics more closely with strategic calls to unify the single market and boost
productivity. A case in point is the ill-judged idea of lump-sum taxes on EU
companies with large turnover. Brussels is right to seek new revenue sources.
But any business levy should be designed within its planned pan-EU corporate
code. Getting a share of the corporate tax base from companies choosing this
regime is better than slapping a new tax on top of existing ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The budget also fails to address the need for more equity
funding for companies in key strategic sectors, set out convincingly in a
report by the European Policy Centre that proposes an off-budget instrument
resembling an EU sovereign wealth fund making equity investments in the bloc.
This is a good idea. So is the EPC’s call to securitise EU-funded common
European industrial and infrastructure projects. Both would boost the growth of
badly needed pan-EU capital markets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A third weakness is the commission’s lack of attention to
providing investors with pan-EU safe benchmark securities. The budget draft
does nothing to promote this. More common debt is a politically explosive idea.
But it need not be raised for subsidising poorer members; a stronger
justification is to fund an EU sovereign wealth fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, the ugly. Brussels commits the statistical sin of
using nominal numbers, which mainly reflect inflation, to claim a large
increase in the budget. The relevant measure of resources is the share of gross
national income the budget allocates to common priorities. The last budget came
to a little over 1 per cent of EU GNI. Adding in the special post-pandemic
debt-financed fund, the total came to 1.7 per cent. The new draft budget is for
1.26 per cent of GNI, but after deducting the money needed to pay down common
debts, it’s a mere 1.15 per cent — an amount that will be further whittled down
in talks. A proposal to spend one-third less of an already tiny share of
resources makes a mockery of all the strategic evangelising. This is a budget
that ensures continued geopolitical marginalisation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the great American philosophers Ralph Waldo Emerson and
Omar Little have argued, if you “come at the king, you best not miss”. If the
EU wants to hold its own in world affairs, it must give itself the resources
for it. Getting more success is more likely for off-budget ideas such as the
EPC’s, common borrowing for a sovereign wealth fund and a delay to paying down
existing debt to free up funds. Both EU and national leaders accept they face
unprecedented, perhaps existential, risks. They must now admit those cannot be
addressed on the cheap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>EU must defend its car safety standards</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The recent agreement between Japan and the US to suspend
vehicle safety requirements for US-made cars is a deeply alarming precedent
(“Washington and Tokyo agree 15% tariff deal”, Report, July 24).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to reports, Japan will now allow the import of
American-market vehicles without requiring them to meet its domestic safety
testing or standards. In exchange, the US will reduce tariffs on Japanese
vehicle exports.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is no trade victory — it sets a dangerous precedent:
trading away road safety for short-term political gain. Europe must not follow
suit. As the FT reports, the EU and US are now close to finalising a trade deal
(“Washington and Brussels close in on trade agreement in tariff ‘shakedown’”,
Report, July 24).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If it includes so-called “equivalence” or “mutual
recognition” of vehicles, it would repeat Japan’s mistake — and expose European
road users to lower safety standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in May, the commission appeared to take a strong line.
The FT reported that Brussels would hold firm on vehicle safety rules despite
US pressure (“EU threatens levy on cars if talks fail”, Report, May 9).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A senior official stated that EU safety standards were not
up for negotiation. The commission must now hold this line — and not give in at
the final hurdle. The safety gap remains stark: EU regulations require
life-saving technologies such as automated emergency braking, intelligent speed
assistance and pedestrian protection requirements — none of which are mandatory
on American vehicles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU’s General Safety Regulation for new vehicles, in
force since July 2024, is expected to save thousands of lives over the years to
come. Brussels must defend it in all trade negotiations — and ensure the public
understands what is at stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>News of a revised tariff rate on all exports from Cambodia

global trade war”, Report, FT.com, July 11) should not be interpreted as a

regime to invest and put Cambodia on a new economic trajectory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The regime has had three months to negotiate a deal that
would protect Cambodian citizens from the effects of these proposed levies, and
to introduce reforms that will better shield the country from future economic
shocks. On both counts it has failed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I call on the regime to firstly prioritise safeguarding
low-income borrowers and at-risk workers in rural, small and medium-sized
enterprises. Second it must modernise the country’s education system, so we
have a workforce fit for the future; and, last, it must tear down social
barriers, so that women have the same opportunities as men to take up
leadership roles in the Cambodian economy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reforms that build greater resilience in the Cambodian
economy, while promoting long-term development and democratic decision-making,
are now essential. If the regime ignores this reality, and the growing demands
of its citizens, Cambodia will remain vulnerable to the actions of more

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Arbitrage trade best suited to long-only investors</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alpha opportunities in the sustainability-linked bond market
are not novel (“The easy money trades lurking in the sustainable debt market”,
Moral Money, FT.com, July 18). A landmark case occurred three years ago, when
Poland’s state-controlled oil and gas company PKN Orlen and its
zloty-denominated linkers triggered a coupon “step-up” (an issuer penalty)
following an unexpected downgrade to its ESG rating. Yet bond prices remained
unresponsive to the step-up, and local investors seemed indifferent to what resembled
an “arbitrage” opportunity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is, indeed, an alpha opportunity in such instances,
but not necessarily a pure arbitrage. These trades are better suited to active,
institutional, long-only investors who can integrate them into their
portfolios. The canonical arbitrageur, referred to by Simon Mundy earlier in
his article and widely assumed to be omnipresent by proponents of efficient
markets, simply has no jurisdiction here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Corporate credit investing is comparatively inefficient: it
requires upfront cash, offers limited leverage, and is not eminently liquid,
with wide bid-ask spreads due to its fragmented over-the-counter nature. For an
arbitrageur, any pricing anomaly must be sufficiently large to overcome these
frictions and to justify the cost of the capital tied up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moreover, such opportunities typically take time to converge
(“weeks”, per the article). This therefore requires arbitrageurs to warehouse
risk on their balance sheets for longer periods than they may be accustomed to,
additionally limiting their ability to redeploy capital across markets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, there are often additional risk dimensions. In the
PKN Orlen case, for example, currency risk added another layer of complexity;
additional risks must either be hedged or absorbed, further deterring pure
arbitrageurs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hence, while sustainability-linked bonds may sometimes
exhibit pricing dislocations, it would be remiss to assume that sophisticated
arbitrageurs are simply overlooking them. These opportunities are best
understood as incremental yield, available to investors already underwriting
comparable underlying risks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hence, it is active, institutional, long-only asset managers
that are best positioned to harvest such mispricings when they align with their
core strategies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Here’s why US capacity to supply Ukraine isn’t infinite</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=382 height=643 id="Picture 1"
src="FT_files/image024.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The editorial “Trump’s overdue pivot on Ukraine” (FT View,
July 21) captures the excitement in Europe at the opportunity to leverage
President Donald Trump’s apparent shift towards supplying Ukraine with more US
munitions. But expectations on both sides of the Atlantic should be tempered by
reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a single recent Russian strike on July 9, Ukraine was
attacked with 728 Shahed-style drones, seven cruise missiles, and six ballistic
missiles. The US currently produces just about 600 Patriot interceptor missiles
per year — fewer than were needed to defend against that single attack if the
system was relied on exclusively. There is no surge capacity left. Expanding
production isn’t a matter of flipping a switch; it’s a years- or even
decades-long process involving labour shortages, strained supply chains, and
complex component bottlenecks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Worse, Ukraine is only one of the regions clamouring for
these munitions. US forces require interceptors for their own operational needs
in the Middle East and Asia, where the threat from Iranian and Chinese missile
stockpiles remains a significant challenge. At a certain point, transfers will
stop — not because of politics, but because there simply won’t be any missiles
left to send regardless of who’s paying for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ukraine is developing its own drone interceptors and
receiving other systems from allies, which helps alleviate over-reliance on
limited US supplies. But these can’t compensate for the scale and reliability
of US platforms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If Europe wants to chart a long-term path to stability, it
must reckon with these hard limits. America is overextended in an increasingly
unstable world, and its capacity to support this war is not infinite.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A wake-up call for all those monolingual Anglo-Saxons</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Simon Kuper struck a chord in his thoughtful piece “AI is
reinforcing the dominance of English in the workplace” (Work &amp; Careers,
July 21).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a Londoner, who studied French and German, I fully agree
with his thesis, but would add a couple more points.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Native monolingual Anglo-Saxons are at a disadvantage. They
will lack the experience of operating in a foreign language and having to adapt
to a foreign culture. Working in the City of London surrounded by those for
whom English is at best a second language, daily reminds me that we
Anglo-Saxons do ourselves no favours. We often speak in ways that make us, at
times, near incomprehensible to non-native speakers. Speed of diction, choice
of vocabulary, obscure expressions compound to confuse good communication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moreover, the cultural awareness derived from having to
immerse oneself in the mannerisms and traditions of another civilisation opens
the mind and sharpens interpersonal skills. While Stem (science, technology,
engineering and mathematics) subjects are critical, it is foolish to ignore the
study of languages that offers an extraordinary insight into human
communications and culture, while at the same time developing critical
analytical faculties. These have certainly contributed to my own long career in
finance. Moreover, the multilingual young professional will outcompete the
monolingual Brit in the jobs market, all other things being equal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So yes, being fluent in English is important for non-native
speakers, but the Anglo-Saxons still need to invest in linguistic skills,
including maybe more Arabic, Chinese and or other Asian languages for future
use. However, the statistics do not look good. Language study across the UK is
falling fast. This is really not a good thing for UK people.</p>
