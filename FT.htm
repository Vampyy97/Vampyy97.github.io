<p class=MsoNormal><b>Brussels accepts 15% US tariffs to fix ‘unfair trade
relations’, says Trump</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=574 height=391 src="FT_files/image001.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>• EU to buy more US arms and energy • Accord with von der
Leyen • Transatlantic strife averted</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HENRY FOY — TURNBERRY<br>
AIME WILLIAMS — WASHINGTON<br>
ANDY BOUNDS — BRUSSELS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The US and EU have struck a trade deal that will impose 15
per cent tariffs on EU products, Donald Trump said yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU has agreed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars
on additional American energy products and weapons as part of the deal, the US
president said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The agreement, which is set to avoid a transatlantic trade
war, was struck during a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von
der Leyen at Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The meeting, which lasted around an hour, saw the sides
agree a deal that was largely hashed out by negotiators earlier last week and
met the EU’s key benchmark of a blanket 15 per cent tariff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Earlier in the day Trump said he wanted to end the bloc’s
“unfair” trade relationship with the US. “We should give it a shot,” Trump said
ahead of the negotiations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sitting next to von der Leyen, Trump said the US-EU trade
relationship was “unfair to the United States … a one-sided relationship”. He
added: “Both sides want fairness.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After reaching the deal, he said that “this is probably the
biggest deal ever reached in any capacity, trade or beyond trade”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump said the EU would spend an additional $750bn on US
energy products, invest $600bn in the US and buy “a vast amount” in US military
equipment worth “hundreds of billions of dollars”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The US president said the US would put tariffs of 15 per
cent on EU goods, including automobiles, in exchange for the bloc “opening up
their countries at zero tariff”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking after the US president, von der Leyen said the new
tariff rate would be “all inclusive”, and described the arrangement as a “good
deal” that had been “tough” to reach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before the meeting von der Leyen said that the EU’s trade
surplus in goods with the US, which hit almost €200bn last year, needed to be
cut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We have to rebalance it,” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The deal is a major victory for Trump, who has spent months
forcing America’s allies into bruising negotiations by threatening steep
tariffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But US trading partners have expressed concern that, even
when they strike agreements with Trump to lower his tariffs, they face
uncertainty over future levies on sectors including pharmaceuticals, chips and
aerospace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EU steel and aluminium imports are exempted from the deal.
Trump said the levies, which he has set at 50 per cent for most countries
across the world, would not be tackled until after an initial agreement with
the EU, dashing the industries’ hopes for an early and low tariff quota.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump had threatened to impose 30 per cent tariffs on EU
products imported into the US if no deal was finalised by August 1, a move that
would almost certainly have sparked retaliation by the bloc and a transatlantic
trade war.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU had prepared a retaliatory package of tariffs of up
to 30 per cent against €92bn of US exports if it could not reach an agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking after the deal was announced, US commerce secretary
Howard Lutnick said the US would unveil new tariffs on chips as a result of its
national security probe into the sector in two weeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>VPN group sees demand rise 1,800% as Britons seek to
evade online safety law</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TIM BRADSHAW — LONDON</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>British internet users have rushed to access services that
disguise a user’s online location after new age verification rules came into
force.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thousands of sites offering adult content, as well as
popular social media apps including X, Reddit and TikTok, have introduced “age
assurance” controls for UK users since Friday to comply with the Online Safety
Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The age checks are designed to prevent children under 18
from accessing sites that carry pornography as well as other harmful material
that relates to self-harm, eating disorders or suicide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But to evade the new rules, a growing number of people are
turning to tools more often used by citizens in authoritarian regimes to get
around internet censorship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Apps offering virtual private networks — which route a
smartphone or PC’s internet traffic through another country, bypassing local
network providers — made up half of the top 10 most popular free apps on the
UK’s App Store for iOS this weekend, according to Apple’s rankings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Proton VPN leapfrogged ChatGPT to become the top free app in
the UK, according to Apple’s daily App Store charts, with similar services from
developers Super Unlimited and Nord Security also rising over the weekend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Proton said it had experienced a more than 1,800 per cent
increase in daily sign-ups from UK-based users. Nord said there had been a
1,000 per cent increase in UK purchases of VPN subscriptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We would normally associate these large spikes in sign-ups
with major civil unrest,” Proton said. “This clearly shows that adults are
concerned about the impact universal age verification laws will have on their
privacy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The UK is one of the first democratic countries to impose
such strict content controls on tech companies, making it a test case that will
be monitored around the world. Several US states and Australia have also sought
to impose age-based restrictions for online services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Platforms in breach of the rules face penalties of up to
£18mn or 10 per cent of global turnover, whichever is greater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Act — which was passed under the previous Conservative
government in 2023 — has also become a potential flashpoint with the US. Trump
administration officials oppose anything they see as a restriction on freedom
of speech.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Israel opens Gaza aid corridors after uproar</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NERI ZILBER — TEL AVIV<br>
HEBA SALEH — CAIRO</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israel said it had started daily “tactical pauses” to
military activity in Gaza and would create “humanitarian corridors” throughout
the strip, an apparent reversal of its policy after months of severe aid
restrictions pushed the enclave to the brink of famine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shift was approved by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu’s government and announced by the Israel Defense Forces amid growing
international condemnation of what UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on
Saturday called the “appalling” humanitarian conditions inside Gaza.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The IDF said the halts to military activity, which began
yesterday, would happen daily from 10am to 8pm in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah and
the Al-Mawasi coastal area, places to which the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.1mn
people have been forcibly displaced and where Israeli ground troops are not
present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, the IDF said the humanitarian corridors would
be in place from 6am to 11pm every day to enable the “safe passage” of aid
convoys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tom Fletcher, the UN relief chief, welcomed the announcement
and said UN teams on the ground “will do all we can to reach as many starving
people as we can in this window”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The World Food Programme also welcomed Israel’s decision to
facilitate access to aid and said it had “enough food in or on its way to the
region to feed the entire population ... for almost three months”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Egyptian Red Crescent said yesterday that it had sent
more than 100 trucks into Gaza carrying more than 1,200 tonnes of flour and 450
tonnes of food packages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, one UN official said they were unclear on how long
the humanitarian corridors would be in place, while another said aid agencies
were in contact with the Israeli military for clarity on details of the new
arrangement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Netanyahu, speaking at an air force base yesterday, said
Israel was allowing the entry of “minimal humanitarian supplies”, as it has
done “up until now”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The UN is creating excuses and lies against the state of
Israel,” he said. “There will be no more excuses. We will continue to act until
we achieve all of our war goals — until total victory.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Israeli air force began parachuting humanitarian
supplies into Gaza on Saturday night, while Jordan and the United Arab Emirates
also airdropped supplies into the enclave yesterday. UK officials said they
were sending additional military planners to Jordan to help co-ordinate the
airdrops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foreign air forces, including those of the UK, France,
Jordan and the UAE, have previously conducted airdrops over Gaza during the
conflict. But humanitarian organisations have criticised them as an inadequate
means of meeting the territory's needs, with one UN official describing them as
a “distraction and a smokescreen”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David Lammy, the UK’s foreign secretary, said that while the
IDF’s announcement was “essential”, it “cannot alleviate the needs of those
desperately suffering in Gaza”. “We need a ceasefire that can end the war, for
hostages to be released and aid to enter Gaza by land unhindered,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Syria and jet deal test Trump and Erdogan bond</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=431 src="FT_files/image002.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JOHN PAUL RATHBONE — ISTANBUL</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was the body language of an established bromance:
Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US President Donald Trump shook
hands, smiled, then clinched each other at a group photo for the Nato summit in
The Hague last month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “extraordinary” relationship of these two “friends”, as
the pair call each other, has so far delivered a string of mutual wins. Turkey
has secured a better position than many US allies on tariffs. Washington has
lifted sanctions on Syria, as Erdogan wanted. Trump has also turned a blind eye
to Erdogan’s crackdown on the opposition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Erdogan has, meanwhile, provided his fellow Nato ally with a
venue for diplomatic talks with Russia, and the possibility of a US military
exit from Syria, which Trump has long wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, however, their relationship faces two significant
tests. The most urgent involves reconciling Turkey’s support for the government
of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa with destabilising Israeli military actions
in the Arab state. The second is to secure the end of US sanctions on Turkey’s
defence sector to allow a multibillion-dollar F-35 fighter jet deal that
Erdogan has long wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You can’t underestimate their chemistry,” Soner Cagaptay,
director of the Turkey research programme at The Washington Institute
think-tank, said of the two presidents. “Trump likes strong countries and
powerful leaders — Erdogan delivers both.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even so, “for all the talk of their bromance, Trump and
Erdogan don’t actually seem to get any deals done,” said Aaron Stein, president
of the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Washington.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nowhere has the “new era in Turkish-American relations” — as
Erdogan has described it — been more evident than in Syria. Turkey’s neighbour
had long been a source of tension because of clashing US and Turkish priorities
— particularly over US support for Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers an
extension of the militant group PKK.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But now Washington appears to all but repeat Turkish talking
points — even when they run counter to Israel’s, which has taken a hostile
stance towards Sharaa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In June, after speaking with Erdogan, Trump used his
executive powers to lift economic sanctions on Syria, a key Turkish ask. Then
the US this month moved to delist as a terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,
the Syrian president’s former movement — making HTS perhaps the first terror
organisation ever to be delisted by the US before it became defunct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This was a big deal for Turkey. It was also a sign of
Trump’s faith in Erdogan,” Cagaptay said. “If Syria is stable, more of the over
3mn Syrian refugees living in Turkey will go back. That in turn helps with
nationalist issues inside Turkey and is a potential vote winner for Erdogan.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tom Barrack, one of Trump’s friends and the new US
ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, is a crucial go-between. Trump
has tasked Barrack — a smooth talking but tough private equity billionaire of
Lebanese descent — with elevating the bilateral relationship from “great” to
“extraordinary”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Barrack criticised Israel for creating “another very
confusing chapter” after it launched dozens of air strikes in Syria during a
wave of deadly sectarian clashes this month, saying it was acting to protect
the Druze religious minority. This rare public censure of Israel from a US
official appeared to provoke a tacit rebuttal from Israel’s defence minister
Israel Katz: “Those who criticise the attacks are not well versed in the
facts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second big test of the Trump-Erdogan relationship is
Turkey’s long-held desire to buy dozens of F-35 stealth fighter jets — a deal
that Erdogan sounded positive about after meeting Trump at The Hague, saying:
“Inshallah, we shall make progress.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the obstacles are formidable. The deal was blocked in
2020 under so-called CAATSA sanctions after Erdogan bought two Russian S-400
air defence batteries. Turkish officials have alluded to the S-400s remaining
stored in unopened crates ever since. But “if used, it would be like Russia
plugging a USB stick into Nato’s computer system,” one western official said.
“That is totally unacceptable for us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Barrack has suggested that a solution, including the
congressional approval required to lift the sanctions, might be found by the
end of this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the meantime, Turkey is seeking to recapitalise its
ageing air fleet by buying Eurofighter jets. Britain and Turkey signed a
preliminary multibillion-pound deal for the sale of Typhoon jets to Ankara last
week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the F-35s, “the successful formula will require both
sides to agree to some concessions to their doctrinal positions,” said Sinan
Ulgen, director of EDAM, an Istanbul think-tank. “Turkey will in essence have
to commit to never using the S-400 in practice — with monitoring to assuage the
trust deficit … But the US will have to show flexibility too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The stakes are high. If the issue is resolved, Lockheed
Martin could get a multibillion-dollar sales order. Turkish companies could
also get reinserted into the F-35 programme, regaining lucrative contracts that
once included building F-35 fuselages and serving as one of the jet’s main
maintenance hubs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s going to be a long haul,” cautioned Stein. “To buy the
F-35s, Turkey will need military financing — which requires congressional
approval. But Turkey is not popular in Congress, and the Greeks and Israeli
lobby will oppose the deal.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Analysts argue that where there is a will there is a way,
and expect that the F-35 deal will get done one day — even if that requires a
Trump executive order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harder to resolve are the growing tensions between Turkey
and Israel. Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said last week Ankara might
intervene if there were further attempts to divide Syria — a prospect that
raises the alarming possibility of clashes between the region’s two most
powerful militaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is Iran. Turkey bit its tongue when the US bombed
Iran’s nuclear facilities in June, issuing only a mild rebuke. But Ankara could
fall out completely with the US if there were to be a second round of the
Israel-Iran war that dealt more blows to Tehran and which led to a huge influx
of Iranian refugees into neighbouring Turkey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Berlin to avoid EU punishment for breaching budget rules</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PAOLA TAMMA — BRUSSELS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Germany will escape punishment for breaching strict EU
budget rules, thanks to an exemption that applies to its increase in defence
spending, Brussels’ top economic official has said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Europe's largest economy is forecast to record an excess
deficit of 3.3 per cent in 2025, but this is fully accounted for by an increase
in defence spending, EU economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told the
Financial Times. Berlin, therefore, “is likely not to end up in [the] excessive
deficit procedure,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU rules — which Germany helped design — dictate that
member states must keep their budget deficit within 3 per cent of GDP and
public debt below 60 per cent of GDP. A country could face fines if it does not
take corrective measures to meet the rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A final assessment of Germany’s position will take place
next spring when full data for 2025 is available, Dombrovskis said, adding: “We
have to see the execution, because it’s close, [but] if everything holds, then
it should not be the case for this year’s budget.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Berlin’s narrow escape signals a willingness from Brussels
to allow the bloc’s largest economy to spend lavishly at a time of higher
defence needs and low growth. Germany plans to exceed a 3 per cent annual
deficit threshold this year to the end of 2027, according to its own fiscal
plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the “national escape clause,” invoked by Germany and 15
other EU countries, allows member states to spend up to 1.5 per cent of their
output on defence over four years without breaking the rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clause was added at Germany's behest this year to
accommodate higher defence spending, given US demands on EU countries to boost
their own security and a new Nato target to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence
by 2035.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The request was a stark about-face from Germany, which
during a recent reform of fiscal rules asked for strict safeguards for
countries that breached EU debt and deficit thresholds. In negotiations over
the past few months with Berlin over its fiscal plan, Brussels granted Germany
a right to “backload” measures to reduce its budget deficit towards the later
years of its plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brussels has also accepted Germany’s estimate for the
potential growth impact of Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s €500bn infrastructure
investment fund and increased defence spending at 0.9 per cent on average until
2041 — up from 0.3 per cent in 2025 — something German officials stress is
allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brussels’ leniency towards Berlin is due to its relatively
low debt levels, projected to come in only slightly above the EU's 60 per cent
threshold at 63.8 per cent of GDP this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The commission has been quite lax in its interpretation of
the fiscal rules towards Germany,” said Guntram Wolff, a senior fellow at
think-tank Bruegel and a professor of economics at the Free University of
Brussels. “At some level, that is understandable given that debt levels are low
and also the deficit levels are small compared to France. At another level, it
is weakening the just reformed fiscal rules.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Procurement chief vows to continue supplier price squeeze</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=368 height=306 src="FT_files/image003.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JOE MILLER — WASHINGTON<br>
STEPHEN MORRIS — SAN FRANCISCO<br>
STEPHEN FOLEY — NEW YORK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Trump administration’s procurement chief has vowed to
persist with a Doge-inspired pricing squeeze on technology groups and
government suppliers, after some of the US’s largest corporations complained to
the White House about his aggressive approach to cost-cutting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Josh Gruenbaum, a former investment banker and director at
KKR who runs the powerful Federal Acquisition Service, has overseen a
months-long review of multibillion-dollar deals with software providers and
consultancies, convincing companies including Booz Allen Hamilton, Google and
Oracle to offer steep discounts on services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Gruenbaum’s sometimes brusque approach — demanding that
the likes of Microsoft, Amazon and Uber identify savings or face the possible
cancellation of lucrative contracts — has sent shockwaves through the tech and
consultancy industries. A letter from Gruenbaum sent to 10 leading consulting
firms in March demanding they justify each individual government contract read:
“A 15-year-old should be able to understand what service you provide and why it
is important — no consultative jargon or gobbledegook.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At least one chief executive complained directly to the
White House over the approach, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One leading US tech group said dealing with the
administration was impossible, and described it as a “circus”. “They are super
aggressive and have upset CEOs and others,” another government contractor told
the Financial Times. They added that airline industry executives were the
latest to complain about the FAS after learning their sector was the next to be
targeted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a recent interview with the FT, Gruenbaum claimed all
negotiations had taken place in good faith. “I can’t think of a single
contentious or caustic discussion I've had with industry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The General Services Administration, which houses the FAS,
claims the procurement review has resulted in more than $52bn in savings, of
which about $12bn comes from consulting contracts. The total figure accounts
for more than a quarter of the purported savings by the so-called Department of
Government Efficiency, or Doge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gruenbaum insisted his team’s approach was “going to persist
for the duration of this administration”. He added that multibillion-dollar
deals were still being reviewed against cheaper options.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We have shrewd business folks around us, we do run market
comparisons,” said Gruenbaum, whose role became more prominent after an
executive order further centralising procurement. “We have typically other
vendors who are like, ‘we could create proper market tension.’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He warned companies that “volume’s going to start shifting”
if government suppliers failed to offer value for money on existing contracts,
“and I think industry understands that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gruenbaum denied the White House was pressing him to go easy
on companies with close ties to the administration, such as Larry Ellison’s
Oracle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The buy-in from … the administration, for us to go and
execute on these things, that’s what’s making this happen,” he told the FT.
“We're not here to, like, just knuckle-drag people,” he said. “There’s a way to
get to a great deal where it’s a win-win, where you recognise ... how important
of a customer the federal government is.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The White House did not respond to a request for comment on
the complaints by chief executives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a subsequent statement, Gruenbaum defended his team’s
approach, saying: “We are tough, but fair, and we take our jobs safeguarding
American taxpayer money extremely seriously — we make no apologies for that. We
stand by our record of success.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Fox-style media site accused of stoking culture war in
Germany</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=320 src="FT_files/image004.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LAURA PITEL — BERLIN</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Leading a tour around the Berlin offices of his rightwing
online media outlet NIUS, editor-in-chief Julian Reichelt says that someone
once claimed that the old brick building used to house a toilet factory. It is,
he laughs, an easy metaphor for his critics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt, a former editor of powerful tabloid Bild who fell
from grace, is accused of stoking tensions over a top judge’s appointment, a
controversy that has plunged the ruling coalition into crisis and raised fears
that Germany is descending into US-style culture wars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now he is the face of an outlet that models itself on the
“frontal, very tough opinion format” of Rupert Murdoch's Fox News. NIUS was one
of the most active “alternative” rightwing sites that ran a deluge of negative
coverage about one of three constitutional court nominees, eventually prompting
the government to cancel a vote on the appointment this month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt seems unsure whether he wants to dispute the idea
of his influence on the vote or be proud of it. “I think it’s predictable and
ridiculous,” he said of the notion that the decision was swung by an online
campaign. “I think it’s what the left in this culture war always claims as soon
as they’re losing.” But he added: “I am more than willing to take the credit
for shaping the debate. And I am very proud of that. I love it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Founded two years ago with a yellow-orange logo and the
slogan “the voice of the majority”, NIUS today has just 43 staff and fewer than
6,000 paying subscribers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is still lossmaking — but is bankrolled by conservative
businessman Frank Gotthardt, who is also a donor to Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s
Christian Democrats (CDU).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Its YouTube viewing figures suggest that it reaches around
250,000 people a day with its flagship two-hour morning live show, which
features negative stories about asylum seekers, questions science on climate
change and rallies against “woke” culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Critics say there is a kind of symbiotic relationship with
the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), with the site echoing the party's
talking points and party officials sharing NIUS content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt says he doesn't “give a fuck” about who retweets
him and that he was not collaborating with the AfD, saying: “I've never
collaborated with any politician in my life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The site depicted constitutional court nominee Frauke
Brosius-Gersdorf as a “radical feminist” who advocated for abortion up until
the final weeks of pregnancy — a claim she has denied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Growing unease within the ruling CDU led to a backlash
against her nomination even though it had already been agreed behind the scenes
with their Social Democrat coalition partners, eventually causing a vote in the
Bundestag to be cancelled. Merz later hit out at the “unacceptable” campaign
against her, which he said amounted to “massive personal defamation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An analysis by the political consultancy Polisphere found
that NIUS published 20 negative stories about Brosius-Gersdorf in the nine days
before the failed vote, homing in on the sensitive subject of abortion, which
is illegal in Germany but in practice decriminalised up to the 12th week of
pregnancy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There were false allegations and slander — and other media
joined in,” said Philipp Salhoff, the company’s managing director. “The new and
interesting thing about this campaign was that it was so successful.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That assessment is not universally shared. Andreas Rodder, a
historian and a conservative standard bearer for Merz’s CDU, said it was too
simple to attribute the fiasco to the online media, adding that a “very broad
and diverse” coalition emerged against Brosius-Gersdorf’s nomination within the
CDU and its Bavarian sister party the CSU.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But one official from the Catholic Church told the Financial
Times that some senior clergy felt chastened after consuming and sharing claims
about the law professor that they later realised misrepresented her views. “We
have to think more carefully in future about our words and how they can be
instrumentalised,” the official said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt says that he is “pro-choice” on abortion and
generally “way more liberal than people would assume,” although he believes
there should be a cut-off point in pregnancy when termination is no longer
allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Critics of the 45-year-old are deeply suspicious about the
game plan behind NIUS — and Reichelt’s own personal motives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Hamburg-born son of two journalists, he rose to become
the top editor of Axel Springer’s Bild in 2017. But he was fired four years
later after facing allegations of lying to his employers over sexual
relationships with junior female staff — claims that he continues to deny and
battle in court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Andreas Audretsch, a Green MP who regularly locks horns with
the NIUS editor online, believes that Reichelt is driven by a “dangerous”
amalgamation of both political and personal goals, fuelled by the idea that
leftwing culture wars destroyed his career.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He seems to think that, if he is able to destroy the system
and the rules of our society, then something else will emerge,” he said. “And I
guess he doesn’t care if this is a rightwing extremist government.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt denied that he was seeking to destroy German
democracy. “Criticising the powerful is keeping the system of democracy alive,”
he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He said that he believes the AfD, which claimed a historic
second place finish in February elections and this year was labelled rightwing
extremist by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, has a few “ugly” figures
but added: “I don’t think it’s a Nazi party.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He also believes that the pact formed by mainstream parties
to avoid co-operating or forming coalitions with the AfD is “an insane
concept.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think we should be way more relaxed with the AfD because
we're a grown democracy,” he said. “We will be able to deal with it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Though shunned by most mainstream politicians, NIUS has
interviewed Jens Spahn and Markus Söder, senior figures from the CDU-CSU who
are both on the right of the conservative alliance. Audretsch, the Green MP,
said that such interviews signalled to conservative MPs “that it’s OK to talk
to Julian Reichelt, that NIUS is important — and if they're launching a
campaign, please start listening.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Thailand and Cambodia to meet for talks</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JOHN REED AND SUN NARIN — SIEM REAP</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Thai and Cambodian leaders will meet for talks today as
fighting continues in a conflict that has killed more than 30 people and
displaced more than 200,000 along their border.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two prime ministers are expected to meet in Kuala
Lumpur, after a weekend in which Thailand and Cambodia accused each other of
continued attacks and US President Donald Trump warned both countries that he
would cut off trade talks if they did not agree a ceasefire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand said yesterday evening that acting Prime Minister
Phumtham Wechayachai had been invited to a meeting by Malaysia’s Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
with Cambodian leader Hun Manet also expected to attend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand warned that it “reaffirms sovereignty over every
inch of its territory” and there would be “no negotiation on maps”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hun Manet said that he would lead the Cambodian delegation
to the meeting, which he said was “co-organised by the United States and with
participation of China” with the purpose of achieving “an immediate ceasefire”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The announcement came on the heels of Trump’s calls to the
Cambodian and Thai leaders. The worst fighting between Thailand and Cambodia in
more than a decade broke out on Thursday around the Ta Muen temple, which both
countries claim, before spreading to other parts of their border region.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump said in a social media post on Saturday that Cambodia
and Thailand “are also looking to get back to the ‘Trading Table’ with the
United States, which we think is inappropriate to do until such time as the
fighting STOPS”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump has threatened the two countries’ export-reliant
economies with a 36 per cent tariff from August 1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand’s foreign ministry said yesterday that Wechayachai
had spoken to Trump and that “Thailand agrees in principle to have a ceasefire
in place”, adding that it wanted to see “sincere intention” from Cambodia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hun Manet said that in his conversation with Trump,
“Cambodia agreed with the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire
between the two armed forces.” He added that he hoped “the Thai side will not
reverse position”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fighting continued yesterday, according to Thailand’s
army, which said that “the first shots were fired into Thai territory in
several areas including civilian homes”, and that it had “responded in
self-defence at limited military targets” since the violence began. Cambodia
said Thailand had been firing into its territory from 2am.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand has accused Cambodia of targeting civilian areas
and hospitals, which Cambodia's foreign ministry has dismissed as a “baseless
accusation”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yesterday, farmers from the border area in Cambodia could be
seen driving tractors with their possessions and families to safer areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A security guard who said he lived about 50km from the Preah
Vihear Hindu temple, a flashpoint in the fighting, said that he had heard about
Trump's intervention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I heard the news, but I don’t know why Thailand still fired
at 2am this morning,” Him Sum told the Financial Times at a roadside grocery
shop. “I think if the US wants to stop the war, they can.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Chile's far right advances as gangs cloud election</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=382 src="FT_files/image005.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CIARA NUGENT — SANTIAGO</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A surge in organised crime has reshaped Chile’s politics
ahead of November’s presidential poll, handing the country’s far right its best
chance at winning power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chile, one of Latin America’s safest and wealthiest nations,
has suffered its first big wave of gang crime over the past five years, as
groups from Venezuela and elsewhere have expanded Chile’s previously niche
markets for drugs, human trafficking and extortion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kidnappings, dismemberments and other once unheard-of
violent crimes have flooded local media and Chile’s murder rate has more than
doubled since 2015. Chileans have long ranked security among their top
concerns, but polls show the issue eclipses all others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That has benefited José Antonio Kast, a politician on his
third run for president who has made a career criticising governments’ handling
of crime and immigration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arturo Squella, president of Kast’s Republicano party, told
the Financial Times: “Chileans can clearly see that the other competitive
candidates have not had the determination to tackle drug traffickers and
organised crime head on. They see that determination in José Antonio Kast.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast promises to draw inspiration from El Salvador’s
President Nayib Bukele, and build a border barrier to keep out undocumented
migrants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A poll by opinion research group Cadem in July projected
Kast to win 27 per cent of the vote, putting him just behind the leftwing
coalition’s candidate, Jeannette Jara, at 29 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But several other rightwingers jointly scored about 25 per
cent, and analysts say Kast would more easily pick up those votes in a run-off
in December, making the election his to lose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast and Jara have political baggage that may put off
moderate voters. Kast, a son of German immigrants and a father of nine, is a
defender of Chile’s divisive 20th-century rightwing dictator Augusto Pinochet.
Jara is a member of the Communist party, which supports authoritarian regimes
in Cuba and North Korea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A Pinochetista has never won an election in Chile, but
neither has a communist,” said Patricio Navia, a professor at New York
University. “This looks like an unprecedented election.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crime, along with lacklustre economic growth, has battered
the popularity of leftist President Gabriel Boric, a former student leader. He
is barred from running for a second consecutive term under Chile’s
constitution. Jara was his labour minister.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boric’s government devoted the first half of his term to
failed efforts to expand Chile’s welfare state and overhaul its constitution. A
later pivot to focus on security, which he now calls his “number one priority”,
was not enough to convince voters and his approval ratings have rarely risen
above 30 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Officials say the arrival of hundreds of thousands of
migrants from crisis-stricken Venezuela, combined with a pullback in state
presence during the pandemic lockdowns, has allowed poorly policed informal
settlements to blossom and created a pool of vulnerable people to exploit,
particularly in northern Chile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Santiago has also changed. Downtown walls are still
plastered with graffiti from protests in 2019 over the cost of living. Informal
street vendors have proliferated and stores shut earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fatal shootings have frequently occurred in bustling
neighbourhoods around the capital’s Central Station and in July authorities
uncovered what appeared to be a “torture house” used by gangs. “Muggers used to
just take your cell phone, but now they’ll shoot you... people don’t go out at
night any more,” said Marco Gonzalez, who sells bathroom fixtures in the area
and plans to vote for Kast. “The government has been too weak to control it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boric’s government has increased security spending, passed
laws targeting organised crime and jailed hundreds of gang members, including
from Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The homicide rate has fallen slightly, from a peak of 6.7
per 100,000 residents in 2022 to six per 100,000 in 2024, and remains among the
lowest in Latin America. But other offences remain stubbornly high. A
government survey published in July found 5.8 per cent of Chileans had been the
victim of a violent crime last year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The state has intensely pursued these criminals ... and we
are achieving results,” security minister Luis Cordero said. “Of course, I
would like the results to come faster, but some will only be visible in the
medium or long term.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast argues the government has not gone far enough. He vows
to strengthen legal protections for police officers who use force, and make it
easier to deport migrants for entering illegally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last year, Kast visited El Salvador’s 40,000-capacity
mega-jail, whose harsh conditions have become the centrepiece of Bukele’s
crackdown on gangs. Squella said they would import “all the elements that are
appropriate in Chile”, including cutting off imprisoned gang members’ contact
with the outside world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We will reclaim the state’s right to use force, restore a
sense of authority, and make police work more proactive,” he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jara, meanwhile, has pledged to recover gang-controlled
neighbourhoods “by investing in infrastructure, culture and a permanent state
presence” and change banking laws to make it easier to track money laundering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast remains the favourite, but analysts said Jara, a
charismatic speaker who grew up in a working-class neighbourhood, was proving
to be an unexpectedly strong candidate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s a strong anti-elitism message within her, which has
worked in many countries recently,” said Robert Funk, an associate professor of
political science at the University of Chile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>China argues for global body to govern AI in challenge to
US dominance</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WILLIAM LANGLEY — GUANGZHOU<br>
ELEANOR OLCOTT AND RYAN MCMORROW — SHANGHAI</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China has unveiled a sweeping plan to expand its role in
artificial intelligence governance, including the creation of a global
co-operation organisation, as Beijing vies with Washington for technological
leadership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking at the opening of the World Artificial Intelligence
Conference in Shanghai on Saturday, Chinese premier Li Qiang said AI innovation
was hindered by “bottlenecks” such as the supply of computer chips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Without explicitly mentioning the US, he took aim at
“technological monopolies” and restrictions that could lead to AI becoming “an
exclusive game for a few countries and companies”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Currently, overall global AI governance is still
fragmented. Countries have great differences, particularly in terms of areas
such as regulatory concepts [and] institutional rules,” Li said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We should strengthen co-ordination to form a global AI
governance framework that has broad consensus as soon as possible,” he said,
adding that China would help create “a world AI co-operation organisation”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Li spoke, the foreign ministry published a 13-point
plan for the global governance of AI that proposed the creation of two new AI
dialogue mechanisms under the auspices of the UN and a safety governance
framework.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In recent months, Beijing has promoted China’s “open”
innovation and willingness to “share indigenous technologies”. The country’s
top AI groups, DeepSeek and Alibaba, have made their large language models, or
LLMs, available to developers worldwide as open-source technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s plan includes a push for greater co-operation on
open-source technology through new transnational platforms and developer
communities, and sharing of crucial software and hardware such as
semiconductors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The country’s swath of advanced open-source LLMs has raised
concerns in the US that low-cost Chinese tech will undermine Silicon Valley’s
global dominance and pricing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Li’s comments reflect the intense rivalry with the US over
the technology, with Washington restricting exports to China of advanced
semiconductors and the equipment used to make them, and pressing allies to do
the same. China has still managed to make advances, with the release of an LLM
by Hangzhou-based DeepSeek this year that sparked a debate about whether the US
could maintain its technological edge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We are willing to provide more Chinese solutions to the
international community and contribute more Chinese wisdom to global artificial
intelligence governance,” Li said, adding that AI would be a new engine of
economic growth. He said China was especially eager to share technologies with
countries in the global south to “make the achievements of AI development
better benefit the world”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s foreign ministry said it had invited representatives
from more than 40 countries and international organisations to attend the
four-day AI conference and exhibition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s plan comes days after the White House unveiled a
plan to achieve US dominance in AI. It focused on accelerating innovation by
cutting red tape, building infrastructure and ensuring the US led in
international AI diplomacy and security.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Brazil to increase its Brics commitment in defiance of
Trump</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MICHAEL STOTT — BRASILIA</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brazil will double down on its commitment to the Brics bloc,
the Brazilian president’s top foreign policy adviser has said, a move that
defies US President Donald Trump’s threats to impose punitive tariffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump has taken aim at Brazil twice this month. As the
country hosted a summit for the 11-member Brics, he threatened a 10 per cent
tariff against any nation “aligning themselves” with the “anti-American” bloc.
Trump then pledged 50 per cent levies on Brazil and demanded it end the trial
of hard-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is charged with plotting a
coup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Celso Amorim, lead foreign affairs adviser to leftwing
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, told the Financial Times those attacks
“are reinforcing our relations with the Brics, because we want to have
diversified relations and not depend on any one country.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On top of the Brics — which includes China, Russia and India
— Amorim said Brazil would look to bolster relations with other countries in
Europe, South America and Asia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 50 per cent tariff is among the highest mentioned by the
US president in his current round of negotiations, despite Brazil running a
trade deficit with the US in goods — unlike many other countries targeted.
Trump also blasted Lula’s government for what he said are attacks on free
speech, a “ridiculous censorship regime” and “very unfair” trade practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lula has rejected Trump's tactics, saying the US president
was elected “not to be emperor of the world”. He added that if Trump’s actions
during the January 6 Capitol insurrection had been committed in Brazil, he
would be standing trial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amorim said Trump’s interference in Brazil’s internal
affairs was something not seen “even in colonial times”. “I don’t think even
the Soviet Union would have done anything like this,” he said, adding that
Trump “was trying to act politically inside [Brazil] in favour of his friend.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While China is the country’s biggest trading partner,
importing $94bn of mainly agricultural goods and minerals from Brazil last
year, Amorim said “it’s not our intention” for Beijing to be the clear winner
from Trump’s higher tariffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amorim denied that the Brics is ideological. He called for
the EU to quickly ratify a long-stalled trade treaty with the Mercosur group of
South American countries. “If the EU were intelligent, it would ratify it not
just for the immediate economic gain but also for more balance in its
relations,” Amorim said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amorim said Canada was interested in negotiating a free
trade deal with Brazil, and added that the last year of Lula’s government was
likely to see greater focus on South America.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remembering the diplomatic maxim that “countries have no
friends, only interests,” Amorim said Trump was an unusual case because he had
“neither friends nor interests, just wishes”. The US president’s approach is
“an illustration of absolute power,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>More private equity backers opt to cash out than roll
over</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ALEXANDRA HEAL AND ANTOINE GARA — NEW YORK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Private equity investors are opting to cash out rather than
roll over their investments when buyout managers seek to hold on to portfolio
companies beyond the life of their funds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Between 85 and 92 per cent of investors have this year
chosen to sell rather than remain invested when private equity groups transfer
a portfolio company to a so-called continuation vehicle, rather than exiting
through a traditional sale or initial public offering — up from 75–80 per cent
last year, according to investment bank Houlihan Lokey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Private equity firms have flocked to the structures, which
allow them to hold on to portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year
lifespan of a fund by bringing in new investors and offering existing ones the
chance to sell their stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Buyout managers argue that continuation vehicles allow them
to retain their best assets and capture further value creation. But their
critics say the vehicles’ popularity is in part because sellers have struggled
to get high enough valuations for assets from external buyers in a tricky
dealmaking environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many private equity backers have instead been taking the
opportunity to sell their stakes in the portfolio company, rather than rolling
their holdings into the new fund, according to Matt Swain, global co-head of
equity capital solutions at Houlihan Lokey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Investors in private equity funds, such as pension funds and
endowments, were “welcoming distributions from [continuation vehicles] with
open arms” because they had “experienced a dearth of liquidity in recent
years”, Swain said, with a lack of traditional exits. Last year private capital
firms sold $62bn of assets into continuation funds, according to advisory firm
Campbell Lutyens, up almost 50 per cent on the year before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Swain predicted that this year 10–15 per cent of all private
equity exits could be done through such vehicles. Jefferies recently calculated
that the vehicles had led to almost 20 per cent of sales across the industry in
the first half of the year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Continuation vehicles usually combine capital from three
sources: specialist secondaries funds dedicated to buying existing private
equity assets; cash committed by the private equity manager; and money rolled
over by the backers of the original buyout fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The vehicles can either house just one portfolio company —
an approach used on prize assets but one that results in a concentrated risk
profile — or multiple assets, where the risk is more diverse but the assets can
include underperforming bets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last year at least two continuation vehicles failed, the
first large blow-ups in the industry. Wheel Pros, a car parts maker on which
buyout group Clearlake had reaped nearly $1bn in profits on selling it into a
continuation fund, filed for bankruptcy, leaving the equity investors in the
newer fund with large losses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mustafa Siddiqui, founder of secondaries investment firm SQ
Capital, said continuation vehicles were used where a buyout fund did not want
“to give the future growth in value to someone else” and for “lemons” that they
could not sell to a conventional buyer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Record flows Chinese investors drive revival in Hong Kong
stocks to end post-Covid slump</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=552 src="FT_files/image006.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WILLIAM SANDLUND AND HAOHSIANG KO — HONG KONG<br>
THOMAS HALE — SHANGHAI</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chinese investment flows to Hong Kong through the Stock
Connect programme have hit a record high as mainland capital drives a revival
of the territory’s equities market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About HK$820bn (US$104bn) of Chinese money has been invested
this year through Stock Connect, which links the mainland’s stock exchanges to
Hong Kong’s, surpassing 2024's full-year inflow of HK$807.9bn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The surge has helped end a post-Covid slump in Hong Kong’s
financial markets and underlines how the city’s fortunes have become
increasingly dependent on policy in Beijing and on Chinese capital.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It also points to a growing appetite among Chinese investors
to put money to work outside the mainland’s tightly controlled financial
system, as yields on government bonds have fallen to record lows amid an
uncertain economic backdrop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Domestic investors are now waking up to the opportunity
offshore,” said Jason Lui, head of Asia-Pacific equity and derivative strategy
at BNP Paribas. “If you're [Chinese] institutional investors, you have no
choice but to start looking outward. There’s actually limited choices for where
you can go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Stock Connect programme, which started in 2014, allows
Chinese retail investors with at least Rmb500,000 ($70,000) to access Hong
Kong’s financial markets without violating China’s strict capital controls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cumulative investment into Hong Kong through Stock Connect
has reached HK$4.5tn, with more than a third of inflows occurring in the past
two years. Southbound transactions now make up about a quarter of daily
turnover on the Hong Kong exchange’s main board, compared with well below 10
per cent on most days in 2019.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The programme is one of the only ways Chinese investors can
buy shares of technology companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, which
are listed in Hong Kong but not in the mainland. Their shares have rallied
sharply this year following the release of a groundbreaking artificial
intelligence model by Chinese start-up DeepSeek and signs of easing tensions
between China’s tech sector and regulators.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hong Kong’s listings pipeline has hit a record high this
year as mainland companies pursue secondary listings in the city. “The Hong
Kong stock exchange has become the main platform for mainland companies to
raise offshore capital,” said David Tsai, a partner at law firm Clifford
Chance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hong Kong’s turnaround has helped rekindle investor interest
in Chinese businesses that were hit by a government crackdown on the private
sector and a property market slowdown now in its fourth year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The longer-term outlook for Hong Kong has improved,” said
James Wang, head of China equity strategy at UBS. “You're not hearing investors
saying: ‘Is China investable any more?’ That kind of rhetoric is well and truly
behind us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Anthropic in funding talks that double its valuation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GEORGE HAMMOND — SAN FRANCISCO<br>
IVAN LEVINGSTON — WASHINGTON<br>
JAMES FONTANELLA-KHAN — NEW YORK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>A</i>rtificial intelligence start-up Anthropic is in
early talks to more than double its valuation to above $150bn in a new funding
round, giving it greater firepower to keep pace with rivals building advanced
AI models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The competitor to Sam Altman’s OpenAI is in the preliminary
stages of funding discussions with investors and has received interest from
backers willing to value the business at more than $150bn, a huge jump from
Anthropic’s current $61.5bn price tag, according to four people with knowledge
of the matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two of the people said final terms had not been fixed but
the four-year-old company was expected to raise at least $3bn, with one adding
that the round could reach up to $5bn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The start-up has spoken to large Middle Eastern investors
and received interest from MGX, Abu Dhabi’s vast AI investment fund, about
joining the new round, according to two of the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anthropic has resisted raising money directly from the
Middle East, although another Abu Dhabi state fund linked to MGX purchased
almost $500mn of Anthropic shares from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX last year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a note to staff, chief executive Dario Amodei warned that
taking Middle East investment could “enrich dictators”. But he added:
“Unfortunately, I think ‘no bad person should ever benefit from our success’ is
a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.” Anthropic and MGX declined
to comment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The group is changing tack amid a fierce battle for funding
that has seen AI start-ups look beyond Silicon Valley to sovereign wealth
funds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anthropic is backed by Google and Amazon. The Financial
Times previously reported that Amazon has discussed plans for further
investment beyond its current $8bn commitment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anthropic is racing OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Big Tech
rivals including Google and Meta to develop AI models capable of producing
text, code and images. Despite their rapid growth, neither Anthropic nor OpenAI
is close to being profitable, with both burning cash to pay for the huge amount
of computing power needed to train their models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Rail groups hope Trump effect keeps tie-up on track</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ROBERT WRIGHT — LONDON</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=373 height=361 src="FT_files/image007.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Jim Vena, chief executive of Union Pacific, announced
last Thursday that the US’s biggest railway had made significant progress in
talks on merging with another network, he used deceptively humdrum language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The company was “in advanced talks” with Norfolk Southern,
the US’s fourth-biggest railway, about a “potential business combination”, he
told participants in the company’s second-quarter results conference call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet to observers and analysts of freight railways in the US
and Canada, Union Pacific’s plans are far more than just another “business
combination”. A successful deal would destroy the widespread assumption that
big Canadian and US railways — which handle about 40 per cent of intercity
freight movements — had become so consolidated that regulators would block any
new attempted merger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A $200bn combination of Union Pacific — which operates west
of the Mississippi — and Norfolk Southern, on the east, would be the first
operator in US railways’ 200-year history able to carry goods all the way from
the Pacific coast to the Atlantic on its own tracks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The deal could prompt BNSF, the other big western railway,
owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, to consider a tie-up with CSX,
the other big network in the east, according to many analysts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tony Hatch, an independent analyst, said the talks had
surprised an industry that stopped expecting new deals after Canadian Pacific
bought Kansas City Southern in 2023. “The thinking was that this would be the
last merger,” Hatch said. “All of a sudden, there’s been a revival of
interest.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Henry Posner, a veteran rail investor and chair of the Iowa
Interstate Railroad, said there could still be considerable opposition from
customers to the creation of a behemoth with the power that a transcontinental
railway would wield. “At the industry level, it’s hard to imagine a
constituency that’s anxious to see a transcontinental railroad merger,” he
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The big question is whether industry regulator the Surface
Transportation Board has changed sufficiently under US President Donald Trump
to brush aside precedent and clear a deal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another question is whether it would approve a “voting
trust”, a key mechanism that in past US rail mergers has allowed shareholders
in a target company to sell up and avoid the risks of the STB’s laborious
approval process, which typically takes at least 18 months.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At a conference in May, Keith Creel, chief executive of the
merged Canadian Pacific Kansas City, pointed out that any new deal would take
place under tough rules introduced in 2001 that required any transaction to
“enhance competition”. Those rules did not apply to the 2023 deal because
Kansas City Southern had an exemption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There is... not a hill of regulatory risk to climb,” Creel
said. “There’s mountains of regulatory risk.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nevertheless, Union Pacific’s advisers appear confident a
deal is possible. Vena has used language apparently calculated to appeal to
Trump's economic nationalism. In an interview with industry magazine Trains,
published in May before the Norfolk Southern talks became public, Vena said: “I
think it’s a win for our customers and a win for competition, and it’s a win
for how the country should move ahead.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advocates for a merger have argued that creation of a single
transcontinental railway would improve the industry’s structure. There are two
big western networks, two big networks in the east, and CPKC and Canadian
National competing in Canada and parts of the US. Long-distance freight often
has to be handed over between operators, frequently in Chicago, which becomes
congested at busy times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hatch said there was also potential for a merged rail
network to make a better job of handling “watershed” traffic from the areas
near the Mississippi that needed to go relatively short distances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet even if it approves a merger, the STB could still demand
in return that a network sell some of its routes to a rival or allow another
operator to use parts of its track.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hatch pointed out in a note to clients this week that any
merger might face opposition from large customers worried that a merged network
would enjoy far more power to raise prices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Posner, who sits on a committee advising the STB on
passenger rail issues, insisted there was no certainty the regulator would bend
with the political wind. The board has a Republican chair but only one other
Republican member, alongside two Democrats and a vacant seat. “I think the STB
is somewhat removed from political pressure,” Posner said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On top of the approval concerns, there is a strong chance
the regulator might bar the use of a “voting trust”. In past rail mergers,
shareholders in the selling company have sold their shares to an independent
entity which has overseen the railroad’s operations during the 18 months to two
years that the STB takes to consider a deal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Canadian National failed in a counterbid to Canadian
Pacific’s offer for Kansas City Southern, partly because the regulator barred
it from using a voting trust. Hatch said that, without the trust structure,
shareholders would face an unattractive period of uncertainty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It remains possible, according to analysts, that Union
Pacific will navigate the many challenges and succeed in its bid to reshape US
freight rail’s competitive landscape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet Hatch stressed that there remained considerable
uncertainties. “We've long thought that the risk and the cost would overwhelm
the benefits,” Hatch said of a potential deal. “It appears that Union Pacific
now think they have a handle on that and they can pull off enough benefit to
make the risks worth it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>AI groups seek to curb chatbot ‘hallucinations’</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MELISSA HEIKKILÄ — LONDON</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=351 src="FT_files/image008.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=329 height=931 src="FT_files/image009.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The leading artificial intelligence groups are stepping up
efforts to reduce the number of “hallucinations” in large language models, as
they seek to solve one of the big obstacles limiting take-up of the powerful
technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Google, Amazon, Cohere and Mistral are among those trying to
bring down the rate of these fabricated answers by rolling out technical fixes,
improving the quality of the data in AI models, and building verification and
fact-checking systems across their generative AI products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The move to reduce these so-called hallucinations is seen as
crucial to increase the use of AI tools across industries such as law and
health, which require accurate information, and help boost the AI sector’s
revenues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It comes as chatbot errors have already resulted in costly
mistakes and litigation. Last year, a tribunal ordered Air Canada to honour a
discount that its customer service chatbot had made up, and lawyers who have
used AI tools in court documents have faced sanctions after it made up
citations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But AI experts warn that eliminating hallucinations
completely from large language models is impossible because of how the systems
operate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hallucinations are a very hard problem to fix because of
the probabilistic nature of how these models work,” said Amr Awadallah, a
former Google executive and founder of Vectara, a generative AI agent start-up.
“You will never get them to not hallucinate.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These errors occur because large language models are
designed to predict the next likely word in a sentence based on statistics they
have learnt from their training data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These mistakes can look like either factual inaccuracies or
the model not aligning with instructions by, for example, summarising events
from the wrong year. What data goes into an AI model’s training set is
important, because the more often a piece of information appears, the more
likely it is that the model will repeat it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The amount that AI models hallucinate varies significantly.
Vectara, which has created a leaderboard tracking these errors, found that some
can hallucinate as little as 0.8 per cent of the time while others as much as
29.9 per cent when asked to summarise a document.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rate of hallucinations initially went up with a new
generation of AI models that are able to “reason”, or solve problems step by
step. This is probably because they are iterating inside of themselves for
longer in order to solve problems in different ways, which leads to a higher
probability of mistakes, said Awadallah. However, the rate of hallucinations
has gone down, as companies have learnt how to build better safeguards for the
models, he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But its research showed that when AI systems are “grounded”
in other sources of information, such as online search, news articles or
internal company documents — rather than just relying on training data — the
number of errors is reduced significantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>AI groups have been focusing on this “grounded” approach to
work out the best methods to help reduce hallucinations as much as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A common technique used by labs is called
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which searches for information from
outside sources, which can be used to fact check claims made by AI systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chatbots from companies such as Cohere, Mistral, Google
DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic offer citations, which show users the sources
they based their generated texts on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In January, French AI start-up Mistral struck a
multimillion-euro deal with Agence France-Presse to incorporate thousands of
the newswire’s articles into its chatbot to boost its fact checking. Both
Mistral and Canadian AI group Cohere also allow their models to be plugged into
the internal data sources of their customers, which allows them to refer to
internal documents for fact checking. That way, the model is grounded in the
context and information that customers want it to process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If you want the model to not hallucinate and to be very
precise . . . the best way is to plug it to the internal databases,” said
Alexandre Sablayrolles, who leads work on agents and RAG at Mistral.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Byron Cook, vice-president and scientist at Amazon Web
Services, believes that applying mathematical logic and reasoning can also help
minimise hallucinations. This led the group to introduce a new safeguard in
December, called automated reasoning checks, that works as an additional test
by its models to validate the accuracy of its responses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some companies, such as Google DeepMind, Cohere, Mistral and
Vectara, also use smaller “evaluator” language models specifically trained to
check the outputs of another language model for errors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most models have the option for developers to toggle the
so-called temperature or how randomly the model should generate the next likely
word. But even the most rigorous technical fixes will not ensure complete
truthfulness, said Nick Frosst, co-founder of Cohere. “It’s not like we can
train a model to only say true things because what is true is dependent on what
is going on in the world,” said Frosst. “And that’s changing and it’s dependent
on your own point of view in some situations.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allowing AI models to search the internet for information
also makes them susceptible to an attack called prompt injection, said
Vectara’s Awadallah. This is where a third party can insert false information
into places where large language models check their information, such as Reddit
and Wikipedia or other websites. This information can then make the AI model
present false information as facts, or disregard its guard rails and
“misbehave”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Google launched its new AI search tool last year, it
told users to put glue on pizza and eat rocks after someone had jokingly posted
that on Reddit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of the challenge for AI developers is reaching a
balance between verifying information for accuracy and enabling the model to be
“creative”. “Building creativity into models makes them more useful but then it
can also lead to more creative, rather than factual, answers,” said Google
DeepMind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>AWS’s Cook noted that hallucinations could also sometimes be
“desired” by users. “If you're trying to write poetry with them, then that’s
actually pretty good. You are looking for weird answers that find weird
connections between things,” said Cook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cohere’s Frosst warned that even the term hallucination was
misleading. “It sounds too much like [the model] working the way a human brain
works, and it does not,” he said. “It works in a completely different way.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>US boards hire more 'boomerang CEOs'</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Number of top bosses<br>
returning to jobs they held<br>
before hits 10-year high</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>STEPHEN FOLEY AND ALEXANDRA WHITE<br>
NEW YORK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The number of &quot;boomerang CEOs&quot; — corporate bosses
who have been brought back for a second stint in the top job — is at a 10-year
high in the US as boards of directors increasingly reach back to the past to
fill gaps in their succession plans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A burst of reappointments in the past nine months, after a
record year for boomerang hiring in 2023, means that 22 companies in the
S&amp;P 1500 are now run by chief executives who have returned to the role,
according to recruitment consultancy Spencer Stuart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They range from household names such as Disney, where Bob
Iger stepped back in to replace his successor as chief executive in 2022, and
Dell Technologies, where founder Michael Dell is on a second stint in charge,
to smaller companies in semiconductors, retail and homebuilding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the latest example this month, Microchip Technology
announced that Steve Sanghi, who ran the company for 30 years until 2021 and
returned last year as interim chief executive, would keep the top job on a
permanent basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Boards have gotten better and more systematic at
succession planning,&quot; said Jim Citrin, head of Spencer Stuart's CEO
practice, &quot;and the key question is, what are all the options? Boomerang
CEOs have tended to be pretty high-profile so now, as part of every succession
planning conversation, it's one of the options.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spencer Stuart data suggests boomerang CEOs typically fail
to match the shareholder returns of their first term during their second
innings. After outperforming the market by 5.5 per cent a year on average
during their first stint, they underperform by 7.4 per cent during their
second, according to its analysis of 86 boomerang CEOs in the S&amp;P 1500
since 2000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The number of boomerang CEOs remains relatively small
overall but the increase has raised questions among investors who assume that
management is grooming the next generation of potential leaders and boards of
directors are casting the net widely for talent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's probably easier and also in some cases prudent to
go to a trusted individual but that doesn't lessen the potential concern of
lack of succession planning for the longer term,&quot; said Bob McCormick,
executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boomerang CEOs are often founders or longtime bosses who are
brought back to put a company on an even keel during a period of turmoil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In May, for example, UnitedHealth, the medical insurance
group, reappointed Stephen Hemsley to replace Sir Andrew Witty after the
company slashed profit forecasts and came under regulatory scrutiny.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jun Frank, head of governance and compensation advisory for
ISS-Corporate, said: &quot;Asking someone to come back is not a sign of bad
governance per se, but it does speak to challenges for the company and may
indicate potential trouble at the board level.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Top artificial intelligence groups are replacing low-cost
&quot;data labellers&quot; in Africa and Asia with highly paid industry
specialists, in the latest push to build &quot;smarter&quot; and more powerful
models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Companies such as Scale AI, Turing and Toloka are hiring
experts in fields such as biology and finance to help AI groups create more
sophisticated training data that is crucial for developing the next generation
of AI systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rise of so-called &quot;reasoning&quot; models, such as
OpenAI's 03 and Google's Gemini 2.5, has accelerated the move away from
employing thousands of low-cost workers in countries such as Kenya and the
Philippines, who are typically paid less than $2 an hour to undertake the
time-consuming task of annotating the huge datasets used to train AI models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The AI industry was for a long time heavily focused on
the models and compute, and data has always been an overseen part of AI,&quot;
said Olga Megorskaya, chief executive and co-founder of Dutch group Toloka.
&quot;Finally, [the industry] is accepting the importance of the data for
training.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This shift has led to a surge in investor interest in
data-labelling start-ups. In June, Meta invested $15bn in the US group Scale
AI, doubling its valuation to $29bn, as part of a push to catch up with rivals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In March, California-based Turing AI raised $111mn at a
$2.2bn valuation, while Jeff Bezos's personal firm Bezos Expeditions led a
$72mn investment round for Toloka in May.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Previously, data labellers would handle simple tasks, such
as drawing boxes on images to identify objects, describing what images
represent, selecting fluent ways to express things and weeding out bad answers
from datasets that often contained violent or graphic content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because AI models need more data to perform better, these
workers were expected to process tasks in seconds and complete hundreds of
tasks during a working day to create vast datasets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, the demand for these tasks had dropped significantly as
many of them could be automated, said Megorskaya.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joan Kinyua, president of the Data Labelers Association in
Kenya, said workers were now being tasked with jobs that relied on localised
language skills and knowledge. The group had also seen jobs in which human
labellers were tasked with conducting final quality control checks for
AI-generated content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As leading AI groups such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Google
attempt to develop models that they claim will exceed human intelligence, there
is a push to focus on the quality of datasets and hiring experts to examine
complex problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What these models now need is data of a real human
using the models to do knowledge work, and getting feedback on when the model
is failing,&quot; said Jonathan Siddharth, co-founder and chief executive of
Turing AI.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To ensure that models perform well in a wide variety of
fields, from coding to physics and finance, deep-pocketed AI companies are now
willing to pay for more sophisticated datasets and experts from around the
world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To attract people from different industries, Turing paid
experts 20-30 per cent more than they received in their current jobs, said
Siddharth. While budgets for data are only about 10-15 per cent of the hundreds
of billions of dollars AI companies spend on computing power, it remained an
&quot;enormous amount of money,&quot; he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>New features and capabilities, such as chain of thought,
which shows how AI models solve problems step by step, were developed by having
human experts show how they broke down problems, said Toloka's Megorskaya.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Experienced software engineers might also be asked to come
up with tasks that are relevant for their field, and then solve them by writing
code, debugging it and checking for security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, validating a physics theory would require
contributions from a physicist to articulate how to build a simulator to test
whether the theory is true, a software engineer to code the simulator and a
data scientist to analyse the results of the simulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The result of this is the model's not just going to be
better than a physicist. It's going to be better than a superposition of
somebody who's at the top in physics, computer science and data science,&quot;
said Turing's Siddharth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Why giving up finance to go back to school can fail</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Craig Coben<br>
After the Bell</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Rodney Dangerfield's 1986 comedy&nbsp;<i>Back to School</i>,
a wealthy tycoon enrols at his son's university and treats academia like just
another business deal. He throws epic parties and hires experts to do his
coursework, such as paying Kurt Vonnegut to ghostwrite a paper on Kurt
Vonnegut. The film's humour lies in the clash between real-world business
practices and academic standards. The professor, for example, gives the
Vonnegut essay an &quot;F&quot;, saying it failed to understand the author's
work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Life sometimes imitates art. While many retiring financiers
pursue board seats or advisory roles, others return to the classroom, searching
for intellectual renewal or maybe just a do-over of their wayward youth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On paper, it sounds idyllic: trading the conference room for
the seminar room, PowerPoint for Plutarch. Academia promises liberation from
client demands, &quot;stretch&quot; revenue targets and quarterly reviews. It
is in part later-life reinvention and in part nostalgia for the carefree
student life that slipped by too quickly - now revisited with the wisdom of
experience but without the old anxieties about grades and exams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reality is often less romantic. What thrilled you at 20
can feel trivial or impractically abstract at 55. Returning to university often
reveals how much you have changed - and how little academia has.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I've spoken to several former colleagues and competitors who
attempted this late-career pivot. The results have been mixed. One ex-banker
enrolled in a computer science master's programme, hoping to co-found an
artificial intelligence venture with a professor, who turned out to have no
commercial acumen. Another began a PhD in economics but left after getting a
master's, disillusioned by departmental turf wars and the asphyxiating
narrowness of academic research. A third did finish a doctorate in anthropology,
enjoying the fieldwork more than the coursework and finding the dissertation a
tedious slog to write.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The adjustment to academic life can be jarring. After years
in senior roles, it is not easy to take instruction from lecturers who may be
decades younger. Academic theories often struggle to account for the messy
ambiguity of real-world business. Where once you wrote one-page memos and used
bullet points in presentations, you're now expected to produce dense,
citation-heavy prose. Concise writing and presentational fluency can come
across as shallow or glib in scholarly settings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The generational gap adds friction. Group projects with
classmates 30 years younger can test your patience. Their certainty may strike
you as naive and dogmatic; you've seen enough market cycles to know how few
things are absolute. But then again, you were once as confidently opinionated
as they are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's the issue. You can't go back because you're no
longer who you were. You're more seasoned, more sceptical. You want to cut to
the point and see the practical application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Logistics complicate things further. Relocating for school
was simple in your late teens or early twenties. At 55 or 60, with a family,
ageing parents, or other obligations, it's not. It's also hard to justify
uprooting your life for a course that may offer few post-graduation
opportunities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, the vision of academia as a fresh career springboard
rarely survives contact with reality. The jobs market does not clamor for
58-year-old graduates with shiny new degrees in biomechanical ethics or
advanced numismatics. A few former financiers I know have secured prestigious
consulting or policy roles but they are outliers. Ageism remains the last
&quot;condonable prejudice&quot; in hiring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For some, this doesn't matter. They're not seeking a career
reboot but something more profound - the chance to discover fresh direction and
purpose and to have a positive social impact. Programmes such as Harvard's
Advanced Leadership Initiative and Stanford's Distinguished Careers Institute
cater to this urge, offering senior professionals a curated curriculum that
combines coursework, networking and bespoke events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friends who have attended rave about them. But with tuition
costs in the region of $70,000, no formal degree and a small number of learning
fellows, they are niche offerings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not everyone returns as a student. A former European
business school dean told me many ex-bankers apply to teach. Some land adjunct
roles - but full-time posts are rare because accreditation rules require a high
proportion of PhDs on the faculty. The appeal is not the modest pay but the
chance to mentor, rather than manage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One former banker I know, now a tenured B-school professor,
keeps 1980s deals &quot;tombstones&quot; - small plaques that commemorate a big
transaction, such as a merger or IPO on his campus office bookshelf and says
students appreciate hearing the war stories.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Retiring bankers can revisit the classroom but not the
person they were when they first walked in. You don't get a second youth, just
a new perspective shaped by experience. And as Dangerfield's character learns,
hiring Vonnegut isn't the same as understanding him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Fed under presidential pressure for rate cut</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=395 src="FT_files/image011.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Will the Fed bow to pressure from Trump for a rate cut?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep
interest rates on hold when it meets this week — despite intense pressure from
US President Donald Trump for a cut — investors will be watching closely for
any hints from chair Jay Powell about the pace of future easing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Markets are currently pricing in a less than 3 per cent
chance that the Fed will cut this month but economists surveyed by Reuters
still expect at least one quarter-point reduction later this year, while
futures markets expect one with a high chance of a second by December.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Fed has been under unusually high pressure from the
president, who has been scrutinising the cost of refurbishing its Washington
headquarters as he steps up his attacks on the chair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump, who appointed Powell in 2017, has called him a
“numbskull” in recent weeks. Powell’s term as chair is set to end next year.
Members of the Federal Open Market Committee have recently been divided on the
issue of whether and when to cut. As of June’s “dot plot” release, 10
rate-setters favoured at least one rate cut by the end of 2025 while seven
preferred no cuts this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It will be interesting to watch whether Powell alludes to
some potential policy easing before year-end, or if he refrains from providing
any explicit forward guidance, given the strong FOMC split,” said Gregory Daco,
chief economist at EY-Parthenon, who said he expects two quarter-point cuts in
2025 and the equivalent of four such reductions in 2026.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Goldman Sachs analyst Jessica Rindels said this month that
she and her colleagues continue to expect three quarter-point cuts, one in each
of the Fed’s upcoming September, October and December meetings, plus a
half-point worth of cuts in 2026. — Will Schmitt</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does the Bank of Japan view the trade deal with the US? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Investors will be eager to hear how policymakers think the
trade deal clinched between Washington and Tokyo will shift the outlook for
growth and inflation, when the Bank of Japan meets this week. Shinichi Uchida,
the central bank’s deputy governor, said this month that uncertainty had
receded because of the deal, a signal that it could be more likely to resume
its tightening cycle. It last raised the policy rate by a quarter-point to
“around 0.5 per cent” in January, the highest level in 17 years. Traders are
putting a minuscule probability on a rate rise this week, according to levels
implied by swaps markets, but are ascribing a two-thirds chance of it coming by
October. “We're becoming more confident in our forecast that the bank will
resume its tightening cycle at its October meeting,” said Marcel Thieliant,
head of Asia- Pacific at Capital Economics. Concerns that the trade deal “could
end up being deflationary in Japan have proved unfounded”, Thieliant added.
However, core year-on-year inflation tracked by the Tokyo Consumer Price index
for July, published on Friday, came in at 2.9 per cent, slightly below the 3
per cent economists had expected. The Bo] “will not be rushing to resume
raising rates”, said analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman. Jan Smith European
Central Bank president Chris- tine Lagarde described its policymakers as being
in “wait-and-watch” mode last week, as they looked for clear evidence of how
global trade turmoil is affecting the Eurozone economy. There will be plenty
for them to watch this week, as a slew of data offers potentially important
signals about how growth and inflation are faring ahead of the August 1
deadline for a trade deal between the US and the EU. After strong growth in the
first quarter fuelled by companies frontloading ahead of tariffs,
second-quarter GDP data due on Wednesday is expected to show year-on-year
growth slowed to 1.2 per cent in the second quarter, according to economists
polled by Reuters. Bert Colijn, an economist at ING, said the GDP figure is likely
to be a “reality check” for Europe, and that “the impact of US developments on
Eurozone GDP will likely have been negative”. Growth data will then be followed
by inflation on Friday, which economists polled by Reuters expect to have
fallen to 1.9 per cent in July, down from 2 per cent in June. Both data points
could alter investors’ views about how the ECB will approach the rest of this
year. Lagarde’s comments, as well as growing optimism about a US-EU trade deal
that could help economic growth, led investors to trim the probability of a
further rate cut this year to about 60 per cent. With doubts starting to emerge
in the market about the chance of another rate reduction, this week’s data
could be influential. Stronger than expected inflation or GDP figures could
mean that bets on another cut to the benchmark rate evaporate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>New office cooling methods seek to end the perils of
aircon</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The focus is now on boosting natural air and reducing
pathogens<br>
using energy-efficient methods, writes Alice Ross</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If<b> </b>there is a silver lining to a summer heatwave, it
is seized on by the back-to-the-office contingent: white-collar workers can
escape the heat thanks to air conditioning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But aircon sits awkwardly with global warming, net zero
targets and energy efficiency goals. It is also a perennial office irritant:
those sitting under a vent have to wrap up warm, views often differ on the
ideal temperature and there is greater awareness of germs floating through
recycled air in a post-pandemic environment. With temperatures rising, the
International Energy Agency has warned that aircon is set to be a huge driver
for electricity demand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enter the offices of the future. In the City of London,
proposed developments at 50 Fenchurch Street and 63 St Mary Axe, and the
recently built 8 Bishopsgate, will use energy efficient underfloor cooling
systems that raise oxygen levels and reduce pathogens, while also employing
radical new ideas such as opening the windows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At 63 St Mary’s Axe, which was approved this month by the
City of London Corporation, an underfloor &quot;displacement&quot; system will
pump in large volumes of cool air through the floor, which will rise as it
warms. At night, windows at the top of the building will open automatically to
let the hot air escape. A similar method will be used at 50 Fenchurch Street,
which Andrew MacKay, associate director at the building's designer, Arup, says
will bring about 30 per cent more outside air into the building. That will lead
to higher oxygen levels, which studies say increase cognitive ability - and
worker productivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MacKay predicts that within five years most new buildings
will have this system, which he notes is also easier on the eye. &quot;When you
walk into the spaces you don't see cooling systems on the ceiling, pipes or
ducts. It's a visually cleaner space.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of the interest in improvements came during the
pandemic when people started to think about the air around them, says Ed
Williams, managing partner at Fletcher Priest Architects, who is working on the
63 St Mary Axe building. &quot;The perception of being able to control your
environment more is a huge benefit that's hard to measure&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most buildings will not allow workers to open the windows
themselves—a sure-fire way to create tension among colleagues over temperature
and draughts. But more are using smart systems to boost the amount of natural
air. The headquarters of Australian tech giant Atlassian in Sydney will use
temperature and wind sensors to determine when to open and shut the windows,
for example. The tower at 8 Bishopsgate will rely on a rooftop sensor to
automatically lower blinds when the sun is stronger, reducing the need for
artificial cooling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Green spaces can also improve air quality. At 63 St Mary
Axe, every floor will have garden access. &quot;That's a fundamental shift you
wouldn't have seen 10 years ago,&quot; says Robert Samuel at Axa IM Alts, the
developer of the building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Williams notes that his team creates taller office spaces
now—helped by the lack of aircon units in the ceilings—to get more daylight
into floors and help with air circulation. &quot;From a designer's point of
view, Covid has been a big benefit as you have to work harder to create spaces
that people want to leave their homes for,&quot; he says.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kriston Symons, an engineer in Arup's Sydney office, says
they used to have a lot of complaints about air conditioning but those have
plummeted over the past decade. One reason is that people who have been working
from home are more likely to be grateful for the office aircon. Another is the
trend towards hot desking and agile working—people are better able to move
around the office to seek out the right temperature for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At 80 Charlotte Street, Arup's London headquarters, workers
can choose where to sit based on air quality. &quot;We're a tech company and
we're all nerds, so we have air quality monitoring all around the building, in
terms of CO2 levels, pollutant levels, temperature and humidity so you can move
around and sit where you're most comfortable,&quot; says MacKay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other advances in technology have made less abrasive cooling
systems possible, MacKay adds: because LED lights give off less heat and cloud
computing has led to fewer big servers in offices, cooling systems can be
lighter touch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some developers remain wary of new technology, which is not
yet tried and tested. Designers also admit the most radical new cooling methods
cannot be realistically applied to existing buildings for cost reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But companies can still improve their workplaces by tweaking
existing systems, points out Brian Motherway, head of energy efficiency and
inclusive transitions at the International Energy Agency. He says offices could
make big savings by just turning up the aircon temperature a couple of degrees
and installing electric fans near people's desks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Electric fans use up to 40 times less electricity than
aircon units, he says, while also giving individuals more control. Women tend
to feel colder than men and some studies have even suggested their cognitive
ability is better at higher temperatures—a further win-win for companies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Developers are also often not using the most energy
efficient aircon models, Motherway says. Governments could play a role here—in
Japan it is common for standards on the best aircon units to be reviewed and
revised upwards more frequently than in other countries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Companies should also talk directly to their workers about
whether they are happy with the temperature, he adds. The likelihood is that
many find it too cold anyway</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Economic uncertainty and offshoring may fuel the decline
in entry-level roles, write Clara Murray and Delphine Strauss</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The rise of ChatGPT made me realise — I’m going to lose my
interpreter job,” said Sophia Sheng. After a degree in advanced translation,
the 23-year-old is now studying for a masters in management at the University
of Manchester, having seen friends in the industry struggle. “I have this fear
that someday a lot of jobs are going to be replaced by AI... [That’s] why I
chose to shift to a completely new field.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many young graduates now share Sheng’s existential fear that
AI will gobble up entry-level white-collar positions and put them out of work
altogether. Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, warned in May that half
of “administrative, managerial and tech jobs for people under 30” could vanish
within five years. Big graduate employers such as BT, PwC and Microsoft are
cutting jobs, while half of UK companies want to redirect money from staff to
AI, according to a BCG survey published in January.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Job postings for entry-level roles requiring a degree have
dropped by almost two-thirds in the UK since 2022 — the year ChatGPT launched —
twice as much as for all starter roles, according to job search engine Adzuna.
In the US, such listings are down 43 per cent over the same period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet while the data points to a tough landscape for new
graduates, it also indicates the causes are more nuanced. AI may be part of the
picture but other factors, including economic uncertainty, post-Covid
retrenchment and offshoring are probably playing an equal or bigger role in
falling graduate hiring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is so far only tentative evidence in some of the most
immediately exposed occupations of AI-related disruption, according to an FT
analysis of the latest available data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advertisements for graduate-level roles have plunged in
several sought-after UK sectors thought to be highly at risk from AI. They were
down by 75 per cent in banking and finance, 65 per cent in software development
and 54 per cent in accounting in June this year compared with the same month in
2019, according to data from job search site Indeed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But listings have also fallen sharply in fields identified
as being under less acute pressure from generative AI, such as human resources,
which was down 77 per cent, and civil engineering, where there had been a 55
per cent drop in openings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oliver Nash, associate director at the Institute for the
Future of Work (IFOW), said there were “multiple drivers” of the hiring
downturn, from the Labour government’s fiscal changes to a decrease in VC
funding and a slowdown in the public sector headcount. “Large increases in
hiring during Covid, especially in tech... could now be being corrected through
a natural process of normalisation,” he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Separate analysis by Indeed found only a weak link between
occupations where overall postings, including non-graduate roles, fell most,
and those where job descriptions had most mentions of AI (suggesting hirers had
rapidly adopted the technology).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pawel Adrjan, director of EMEA economic research at Indeed,
said the findings were likely to reflect the tech sector’s particular problems
and a broader downturn in the UK jobs market. “Against this backdrop, it’s hard
to distinguish any possible subtle impacts of AI.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, FT analysis of US official data showed there was
no clear correlation between an occupation’s potential exposure to generative
AI (on an International Labour Organization measure of the tasks susceptible to
automation), and whether it lost young workers between 2022 and 2024.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Looking specifically at occupations considered to be at high
or moderate risk from generative AI, some graduate roles such as graphic
designers and management analysts have thousands fewer workers aged between 20
and 24 than in the year ChatGPT launched. The drop is also noticeable in some
highly exposed occupations that are not so popular with graduates, such as
insurance claim assessors, credit counsellors and loan interviewers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But in other graduate sectors, such as accountants and
auditors, youth employment was booming as of last year, according to US
government statistics — and this holds for many tech sector roles, despite a 2
per cent decline in young people employed in software development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other US government data to June 2025 shows that a recent
rise in unemployment among young men with college degrees was concentrated in
manual sectors such as construction and production, rather than white-collar
occupations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David Autor, professor of economics at MIT, said political
turmoil in the US, including whipsawing tariffs, the government slashing its
contracts with big consulting firms and cuts by the so-called Department of
Government Efficiency (Doge) to scientists and federal workers, were probably
having more impact than new technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Outside some specific occupations [such as] programmers, I
think it’s premature to ascribe recent labour market woes to AI,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karin Kimbrough, chief economist at the professional network
LinkedIn, argued that while new technology could play a role, the main driver
of a countrywide slowdown in entry-level hiring was the uncertainty over the
global economic outlook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Paramount... is the uncertain macroeconomic environment. We
know from our data that when hiring slows overall, entry level workers feel a
bigger impact,” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recruiters and other intermediaries said another factor was
companies stepping up offshoring as they sought to cut costs, and as the growth
of remote work made it possible to outsource more complex tasks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Most corporates are in a space where offshoring comes
before AI,” said Neil Carberry, chief executive of the UK’s Recruitment &amp;
Employment Confederation, whose members are seeing businesses move call centre
jobs abroad in tandem with the deployment of chatbots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kimbrough added that entry-level hiring remained strong in
developing economies such as Brazil, Mexico and India.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>None of this is likely to reassure graduates under pressure
to adopt AI as they enter a workforce where career structures are in flux. Kyle
Tan, the 24-year-old founder of Headstart, a UK agency placing student interns
with start-ups, said the arrival of AI in a weak economic environment had
created “a kind of superstorm” where employers would train fewer graduates and
expect more of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others take a more optimistic line, arguing that graduates
who have grown up with ChatGPT are well placed to make the most of the new
tools and bring new skills to employers. Micha Kaufman, founder of the
freelancing platform Fiverr, said Gen Z was driving a surge in UK-based
freelancers advertising on the site, which could reflect fewer permanent roles.
But he noted that young people were “actively in demand because they are AI
natives, meaning they are using AI to compensate for their lack of experience.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From a client perspective, “you get someone who is not super
expensive — and they can already produce more,” he claimed. “There is a case to
say that entry level [professionals] are actually going to be in higher
demand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some economists warn it is still too early to measure AI’s
labour market effects. “We should be wary of dramatic headlines about AI’s
impact on hiring,” said Nash of the IFOW. “Not only because it is very hard to
parse this from other drivers but also because ‘AI hype’ can itself become a
self-generating problem as people think that ‘this is what other businesses are
doing.’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Auterion to ship 33,000 AI drone kits to Ukraine</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>US-German software company Auterion will send tens of
thousands of its artificial intelligence drone &quot;strike kits&quot; to
Ukraine to help it combat mass attacks by Russian drones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lorenz Meier, Auterion chief executive, said the company
would ship 33,000 of its AI strike systems to Ukraine before the end of the
year under a new contract with the US Pentagon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The company's software is already being used in Ukrainian
drones operating combat missions against Russia, but the new commitment, Meier
told the Financial Times, was &quot;10 times in scale&quot;. &quot;So we've
shipped thousands and we're now shipping tens of thousands,&quot; he said,
adding that the scale was &quot;unprecedented&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Russia's air campaign has escalated in recent weeks, with
hundreds of Iranian-designed Shahed attack drones used in each strike. A single
bombardment now frequently surpasses the number of drones previously launched
over the course of a month. Major cities are being targeted with increased
frequency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The swarm tactics are also breaching Ukraine's air defences
more often, with strikes hitting targets at roughly three times the usual rate
in recent months, according to official data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Auterion's &quot;strike kits&quot; — miniature computers
known as Skynode that run the company's software and include a camera and radio
— can transform manually controlled drones into &quot;AI-powered weapons
systems&quot; that cannot be jammed and can track a moving target from as far
away as 1km, said Meier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The commitment comes after Auterion, which is headquartered
in Virginia in the US, secured a contract worth close to $50mn from the
Pentagon to deliver the systems. The contract is part of the US government's
security assistance to Ukraine, said Meier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was not part of a drone &quot;mega-deal&quot; that
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this month said he was discussing with
his US counterpart Donald Trump, with the aim of boosting industrial
co-operation between the two countries. But Meier said that his company had
&quot;pioneered&quot; US-Ukrainian co-production.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's basically acknowledging that the battle-hardening
that has happened in Ukraine of drone products is relevant. That it's a way to
support Ukraine, but it's also technology that... Nato countries want to get
their hands on.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meier said he expected further deals for Auterion software
with European countries. The company also has offices in Munich. Auterion's
software, said Meier, would enable the &quot;next evolution in warfare&quot;,
allowing swarms of autonomous drones to communicate with each other. &quot;What
we are providing is leapfrogging what's on the battlefield right now, which is
to go to AI-based targeting and swarming.&quot; Humans would always select the
targets, though, he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The company has sprung a surprise with the anarchic Bananza
game for Switch 2 — but does it justify buying the new console? By Tom Faber</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A number of times in the two months since I got my Switch 2,
I've turned the console on, still buzzing with the excitement of a new toy,
clicked around the menus for a while, and then turned it off again. I couldn't
find anything exciting to play.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s common for new consoles to feel a little thin in terms
of games for their first year or two, but even by the industry’s meagre
standards, the Switch 2’s launch line-up was weak. It had one appealing
exclusive in Mario Kart World, which is fun for racing a few laps with friends
but doesn't invite long, deep sessions of play.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nor does the console offer a thrill in its hardware.
Nintendo has a reputation for thinking outside the box with playful hardware
innovations (such as the Wii's motion controls or the Switch’s TV/handheld
hybrid design), but the Switch 2 is a machine whose improvements feel
incremental rather than revolutionary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what is there to feel excited about? And for those on the
fence, is it worth buying the new console yet?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nintendo’s answer to both of these questions has just
smashed through the wall in the form of Donkey Kong Bananza, a new game with
the Switch 2’s fortunes riding on its muscular, simian shoulders. It’s a 3D
platformer, a genre staple for the company, but also a surprise in that it
stars Donkey Kong, a B-tier Nintendo mascot, rather than a leading man such as
Mario or Link. As if to allay concerns, the normally tight-lipped Nintendo made
the unusual move of revealing who at the company was responsible for making the
game — the same team that made 2017’s Super Mario Odyssey, which set a modern
standard for the genre.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The DNA of Odyssey is abundantly clear in Bananza’s basic
formula. As Donkey Kong, you traverse large open worlds seeking hidden crystal
bananas, sometimes diving through portals for linear combat and platforming
challenges. The world design shows the developers firing on all cylinders, with
each space overflowing with clever secrets, beautiful details and stunning
vistas. Nintendo truly is gaming’s answer to golden-era Pixar — no other studio
is operating at this level of inspired, family-friendly game design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each of Nintendo’s banner 3D platformers has a central
gimmick, from the water jets of Super Mario Sunshine to the gravity-warping
planets of Super Mario Galaxy, and it’s here that the choice of Donkey Kong, a
character whose fists are larger than his brain, makes sense — Bananza is all
about destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whereas a Mario game has you balletically running and
jumping around a carefully sculpted environment, in Bananza you can just smash
through to the other side. Punch through mountains, pummel your way underground
and giddily terraform however you see fit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you progress through lush forests, alien moonscapes and
sunset canyons, you learn to use your destructive capabilities tactically. The
game encourages players to pay attention to the materiality of its world — each
area of the landscape has its own properties and hardness, from volcanic lava
to poisonous swamps, and you must combine these strategically to defeat enemies
and progress. Later you gain access to special animal transformations, the
titular “Bananzas”, which allow you to sprint, fly and — of course — punch even
harder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something about smashing through these beautiful landscapes
feels gloriously anarchic, and while Nintendo isn't the first to do it —
there’s Minecraft, and the smart demolition puzzler Teardown — it’s still a
surprise that a company known for tight control and careful design is willing
to give the player so much agency to deform terrain and reshape its game
worlds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this is the new direction Nintendo embarked upon in
recent Zelda games, encouraging creative problem solving in Breath of the Wild
and Tears of the Kingdom. Whatever the player wants to do, the game tries to
say yes, allowing for a high degree of chaos and unpredictability without ever
breaking — an impressive technical feat. Bananza wholly satisfies two divergent
but primal gamer desires: to feel clever, and to smash things. What more could
you want?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a couple of months with my Switch 2, I've warmed to
the console. Although little about its design feels novel, the hardware boasts
dozens of small, thoughtful improvements that make it feel like a sleek,
grown-up gaming device, compared to which the original resembles a plastic toy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These include more ergonomic Joy-Con controllers which snap
into place with satisfying magnets, and a larger screen which is better suited
to multiplayer sessions on the go. Then there’s the increased processing power
which means that games whose frame-rates struggled on the original Switch, such
as Fortnite or recent Pokémon and Zelda titles, now run as smooth as butter.
The Switch 2 makes most sense if you look at it like a phone upgrade — it’s
still a Switch, just better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are other decent games to play, too. Mario Kart World
does not move the needle significantly since the excellent Mario Kart 8, but
it’s still a great lark, with races now handling 24 players and a new knockout
mode where four players are eliminated each lap until only the best remain to
fight for gold. Super Mario Party Jamboree is another multiplayer offering with
new minigames utilising the console’s camera and mouse control capabilities,
hardware additions which have so far yet to prove themselves. A number of
quality third-party games also have Switch 2 releases, including Cyberpunk
2077, Hitman: World of Assassination and Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut, alongside
strong indies such as Deltarune and No Man's Sky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The received wisdom with new console releases is to wait a
couple of years for a good library of games to be established before investing
in the hardware (the hardcore fans will buy on day one anyway — they already
made the Switch 2 the fastest-selling console in US history). Donkey Kong
Bananza is undoubtedly the first great game for the Switch 2, but it isn’t
quite enough to justify the purchase of a new console alone. Plus, Nintendo’s
upcoming release schedule looks murky. The only exciting game on the horizon is
sci-fi shooter Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, but the company might have something
else up its sleeve for the holiday season.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One quality that continues to set Nintendo apart from its
rivals is that it still puts a lot of stock in console-exclusive games. As
Microsoft and Sony move towards a hardware-agnostic position, allowing players
to access their games on a variety of devices, Nintendo still doggedly insists
that you can only play Nintendo games on a Nintendo console.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘Bananza satisfies two primal gamer desires: to feel clever,
and to smash things’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For this reason alone, fans of the company’s unique approach
to game design will want to invest in a Switch 2 at some point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Donkey Kong Bananza teaches us something else, too — that
Nintendo hasn't forgotten what it does best. It might have played it unusually
safe with the design of the new console, but this boldly strange game shows
that it plans to continue trying to surprise as well as delight, to maintain
its reputation as a company that always finds unexpected new ways to deliver
joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each morning, Christos Papapetrou looks to the sky. “We all
do,” says the head of Cyprus’s farmers’ union. “We're hoping for clouds, for
rain.” But as their island enters a third consecutive year of drought, there is
little sign of either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This summer, for the first time in recent memory, Cyprus
will be forced to import tomatoes, watermelons and other produce it has long
grown, because farmers cannot irrigate. The government has halved agricultural
water allocations, cutting off seasonal crops entirely. “We’ve accepted it,”
Papapetrou says. “But let’s not pretend this is just a farmers’ problem. It
affects the whole country. Prices will soar.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As climate change makes rains more erratic and groundwater
sources run low, governments across the world are seeking solutions to keep the
taps running — a boon for the fast-growing desalination industry, which market
researchers think will exceed $20bn in 2027. In 2024, it was estimated at less
than $15bn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Cyprus, years of under-investment, fragmented
policymaking and reliance on rainfall have brought the water system close to
collapse. As of early June, the country’s 18 main reservoirs were just 21.7 per
cent full. Five years ago, that figure was 97 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Doubling down on energy-intensive desalination is now seen
as the only viable option. Cyprus already has four large-scale desalination
plants that it operates during water scarcity. Maria Panayiotou, the country’s
agriculture minister, has made desalination the centrepiece of a 28-point
emergency water plan, aiming to meet all of Cyprus’s drinking water needs
through desalination within two to three years by operating the units
continuously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The southern European state is just one country in a
widening water-stressed zone, loosely encircling the globe from India across to
North America, with parts of the Pacific and southern Africa also affected. An
estimated one in 10 people now lives in a country with what the UN’s water
agency classifies as “high and critical water stress.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As populations and economies grow, “societies are becoming
thirstier and thirstier”, says Kaveh Madani, director of the UN University
Institute for Water, Environment and Health. “We have limited renewable water
supplies that are now becoming even more limited than before thanks to climate
change.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘Now we're even thinking about desalinating and transferring
water for 800km. This is how desperate people are.’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The desalination process has improved drastically in recent
decades, finally pulling away from the ancient technique of boiling seawater to
more sophisticated technology, reverse osmosis, that uses microscopic pores in
specially designed membranes to filter out salt. Professor Nidal Hilal,
director of the Water Research Center at New York University Abu Dhabi,
estimates that global growth in desalination capacity is between 6 and 12 per
cent annually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But both the older thermal technique and the newer version
have the same problems: they require large amounts of energy to power the
plants, and the process produces pollution in the form of ultra salty water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, with demand rising, companies and governments from the
Middle East and beyond are ploughing billions into scaling up the desalination
infrastructure needed in a warmer, drier world, while wrestling with the
technology’s unpalatable side-effects. “It produces a lot of brine. It affects
the ecosystem. Significantly,” says Madani.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet for some countries, desalination is the only answer.
“Now we're even thinking about desalinating and transferring water ... like
transferring water for 800km,” he adds. “It sounds crazy, but this is how
desperate people are.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The driving force behind desalination’s modernisation are
the communities around the Gulf, whose existence depends on the process. The
oil-rich Gulf state of Kuwait, which has no permanent rivers and was once
forced to ship freshwater in from neighbouring Iraq, pioneered the technology
in the Middle East by commissioning its first desalination plant in 1951.
Similarly parched neighbours quickly followed suit. Today the arid Middle East
and North Africa region accounts for about 70 per cent of global desalination
capacity, according to the EU Blue Economy Observatory. The region’s largest
plants can produce enough water to supply more than 1 million people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Below the undulating surface of the Arabian Sea, thousands
of cubic metres of water flow into pipes tall enough for a person to stand up
in, running over a kilometre back to Oman’s biggest desalination plant, Barka
IV, which uses reverse osmosis. Getting the seawater into the plant is
difficult. It has to be siphoned gently, to avoid drawing in sea creatures. A
wall of bubbles billows around the intake pipes to ward off jellyfish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The salty water that flows into tanks is green with algae,
which must be pushed to the surface using air bubbles, creating a sludgy carpet
that can be skimmed off before filtration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This pre-treatment must be completed before the water is
pushed at high pressure through delicate membranes. After that, minerals are
added to the pure water. The leftover super-salty brine is diffused back into
the sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sea in the Gulf is “the hardest water to desalinate on
the planet,” according to Hilal of NYU Abu Dhabi. The semi-enclosed Gulf is
much saltier than larger, more open bodies of water. And “the higher the salt
concentration, the more energy is required for desalination,” Hilal says,
adding that the situation is aggravated by the water's high “turbidity” or
cloudiness, due to the sea’s shipping routes and the presence of wastewater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A typical desalination plant process</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Seawater is drawn in...</li>

 <li class=MsoNormal>...and highly salinated saltwater</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>In some cases the saltwater can be mixed with cooling

     environmentally acceptable levels.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reverse osmosis — if pressure is applied to the solution,
the flow can be forced to reverse; this is useful in desalination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sources: Tampa Bay Water</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The industry has attempted to reduce energy consumption by
switching to reverse osmosis, like at Barka IV, which is far less intensive.
“It’s around a fourth, or a fifth even, of the energy required for the thermal
desalination technology,” explains Hilal. “The membrane technology has
developed a lot and we are still, in my opinion, on the surface of it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reducing energy consumption has made producing desalinated
water less polluting in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced the
costs. In Israel, water produced by the Sorek B desalination plant is priced at
about 40 cents per cubic metre, which is enough for 25 showers, according to
Thames Water. Dubai utility Dewa will get a price of 37 cents per cubic metre
for water from its Hassyan desalination plant, which is due to start operations
next year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We've put a lot of money in R&amp;D... to be able to reduce
this energy consumption,&quot; says Estelle Brachlianoff, chief executive
officer of energy and water company Veolia. “We've divided [the cost] by five
in the last 12 years.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The €22.4bn French multinational is one of the utility and
engineering companies profiting from the world’s increasing water fragility.
The company says 18 per cent of global desalination capacity already runs on
its technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Academic researchers are focusing on improving the membranes
by looking for materials and techniques to prevent them getting clogged up with
residue, which shortens their lifespans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there are hopes reverse osmosis desalination can be made
even more energy efficient. In the US, so-called deep-sea desalination is being
piloted, using the pressure of the ocean itself to push seawater through the
membranes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the benefits of cheaper desalination are not enjoyed by
all. Cyprus is using reverse osmosis but imports fossil fuels to power it,
meaning each cubic metre costs €1.50 to produce — almost five times as much as
the new Hassyan plant in Dubai.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The government plans to retrofit pumping stations with solar
panels, but space on the island is limited and its grid lacks the storage
capacity to support more water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Desalination can’t run in fits and starts,” Panayiota
Hadjigeorgiou, former head of the water development department, says. “It needs
reliable power.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gulf is still reliant on the older technology, which has
a long lifespan. Dubai, the Arab Gulf’s second-biggest city by population after
Riyadh, gets 86 per cent of its desalinated water from thermal distillation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Companies in the region say they want to change this. Taga,
the Abu Dhabi utilities company that provides the city with desalinated water,
aims to have 66 per cent of its desalination capacity use reverse osmosis by
2030, up from 40 per cent today. It has also added 70 megawatts of solar power
to its vast Taweelah plant, which uses reverse osmosis, to reduce its use of
fossil fuels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s a priority for us that we be more efficient,” says
Taqa’s chief executive, Jasim Husain Thabet. “Therefore we are rolling out more
reverse osmosis” and eyeing other initiatives including reusing wastewater and
curbing losses from leaking pipes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even as emissions from desalination fall, there is the
intractable problem of brine, the ultra-salty substance left behind after pure
water is extracted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Desalination worldwide produces 150 million cubic metres of
brine per day, according to scientific research. This thick, milky liquid is
generally dumped back into the sea. One study has linked desalination brine
with coral bleaching in the Gulf of Aqaba and others have found impacts on
marine life on the sea bed around discharge points.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cyprus is particularly worried about brine’s impact on the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“For every cubic metre of freshwater, nearly half a cubic
metre of brine is discharged,” says Hadjigeorgiou. The island uses offshore
pipelines and diffusers to spread the brine up to 2km from the coast, away from
sensitive ecosystems, and “there’s no evidence of damage so far, but we must
stay vigilant,” she says.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the small, shallow Gulf, which feeds more than 800
desalination plants, jettisoning brine has led to concerns about rising salt
concentration and the impact on sensitive species.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There are challenges with brine discharge,” acknowledges
Taqa’s Thabet. “It’s not limited to us, it is an industry-wide problem that
needs a collective action.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Academics in Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest desalinated
water producer, are trying to tackle the brine problem. Zhiping Lai, a
professor at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, is mining
the brine for valuable elements. His team has published in the journal&nbsp;<i>Science</i>&nbsp;a
novel method for extracting lithium, which is used in making batteries, and Lai
has established a start-up to try to commercialise the new technique.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In principle if we could extract lithium from this brine,
it could enhance economic viability to solve this issue,” says Lai. Although
lithium is found in very low concentrations in brine, “the kingdom is willing
to spend efforts to solve this challenge.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With desalination such a high priority in the Gulf, Veolia
boss Brachlianoff says governments there have found successful models for
contracting and financing the projects. These are usually private-public
partnerships with “specific financing, specific take or pay models from the
customer”. She highlighted the UAE, which has awarded three projects to Veolia
in recent years, all through private-public partnership models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Veolia says the Middle East market was its fastest growing
last year across its different services. “Water technologies is one of its
fastest-growing services worldwide, with reported sales of nearly €5bn last
year.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Middle East “was always aware that water was something
absolutely needed for industry. So we have desalination plants to serve
refineries in the Middle East, not only to serve the population or to serve
industries,” says Brachlianoff. “This realisation that you need water for
everything, of course, [is one on] which Europe is quite behind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Veolia has plenty of multinational competitors. Spain’s
Acciona, whose water division had 2024 revenues of €1.2bn, has contracts to run
desalination plants from Perth, Australia, to Qatar and a market capitalisation
of €9.3bn. South Korea’s Doosan Enerbility also operates desalination
facilities across the Gulf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Middle Eastern infrastructure builders are also looking to
export their desalination expertise. Riyadh-listed ACWA Power is the region’s
biggest power and water developer. It says it controls more than a quarter of
the desalinated water in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman and Bahrain. “We are now
looking abroad [beyond the Gulf],” says Marco Arcelli, chief executive. “We
hope to be signing soon agreements in Azerbaijan, Senegal. We're looking at
projects in China, in Malaysia, in the Philippines.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet some experts warn that desalination, while profitable
for companies, is far from the sole solution to water shortages. Countries are
also investing in improving water infrastructure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The European Investment Bank, for example, lent some €400m
to water projects in Spain last year, which paid for the renovation or
installation of 2,000km worth of pipes. Between 2023 and 2024, the
drought-affected state of California spent $63m on water recycling, capture and
storage projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We have the commercial system and we have the desperate
governments on the other side,” says Madani, the UN University official. “It’s
much easier to increase supply than cut consumption.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He adds that reducing water use and harnessing wastewater
are also critical. “Desalination can play and will play a major role… But it’s
not the solution. That means building the biggest desalination plant in your
country is not necessarily something to celebrate.”</p>

in June — for the first time since January — there are few who believe that
sustained price growth is returning. A lack of demand remains a problem.
Beijing has made a few efforts to encourage consumers, but it will need to go
further, including by bolstering the country’s patchy benefit and pension
provisions, which incentivise precautionary savings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Either way, there is little hope of China beating
deflationary dynamics unless the Chinese Communist party addresses the other
side of the ledger too — that of excessive supply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Annual growth in producer prices has been negative since
October 2022. Limited appetite among consumers at home forces Chinese factories
to keep prices down in order to grab as much market share as possible. But low
prices in China’s supply chains are also the inevitable consequence of
aggressive competition in traditional industries such as steel and cement, and
modern ones, including electric vehicles, solar panels and artificial
intelligence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After initially denying foreign concerns about overcapacity,
Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leading officials have attacked domestic
manufacturers for what they call <i>neijuan</i>, or “involution” which, when
applied to industry, alludes to excessive price competition. Beijing’s own
policies are largely to blame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over recent years, the president has reiterated the
importance of “new quality productive forces” to China’s economic progress. The
strategy emphasises the development of advanced technologies and new
industries. This is triggering a free for all in the country’s state-led
capitalist model. Businesses clamber into new industries to attract political
support and prestige. Local governments — with their own economic targets,
handed down from the centre — then tend to shower emerging industries with
subsidies, tax breaks and protections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the result is a surge in investment, rife with
duplication. Factories and production lines are often established with little
regard for downstream demand. As stock piles up, retail prices get slashed —
sometimes below cost — as producers try to maintain their market share. Ports
are turned into EV car parks, and AI chips lie idle in newly constructed data
centres.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is getting harder for Chinese manufacturers to export
this oversupply. Its trading partners now have heightened awareness of the
impact of importing cheap products on their domestic industries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beijing is trying to pressure provincial politicians and
industries to clamp down on “involution”. The cement, steel and construction
sectors have all suggested they will make adjustments. Controlling
hyper-competitive industries, however, will not be straightforward without
significant reforms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The state’s largesse needs to be curbed; a unified national
market might help restrain local governments’ ability to offer distorting
incentives. Shifting provincial targets away from GDP would alleviate the
narrow focus on output. Tighter intellectual property frameworks could slash
duplication and encourage more innovative differentiation. In other words,
Beijing needs to nurture the conditions for freer and fairer competition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s possible that Xi focuses on setting caps and pressuring
producers to reduce output. He may be conscious of overcorrecting since he has
made modern manufacturing the central pillar of China’s growth model. But
Beijing will do well to realise that its excessive support is the problem. The
state can build factories — but it can’t manufacture efficiency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The Very Online Right has come for Britain too</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jemina Kelly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as I heard the opening line, spoken — in a
serious-newsreader voice — over a piece of generic classical library music and
drone footage of some random hills, I knew it was going to be bad: “Britain. An
ancient place.” But I don't think I realised quite how bad GB News’s “Yookay vs
Britain: How immigration transformed a nation” documentary was going to get.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was to be a “deep dive into Britain’s exponential
change in the face of uncontrolled mass migration”, we are told. “At the turn
of the millennium, Britain took a radical new path on immigration . . . was
Britain ready for this?” the blurb reads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The funny thing was, that question is never addressed. The
majority of the first half of the documentary focuses on the violence of UK
“drill” music, during which we are shown extensive interviews with two
British-born musicians. The rest largely consists of some pretty transparent
race-baiting and non sequiturs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This is a story about immigration,” the presenter Steven
Edginton tells us in his voiceover, as we are shown footage of a Black woman
being asked what it means to be British. “It means that although I’m British
and I’m born in this country, that I'm still rejected as a Black person,” she
replies. “Welcome to the yookay,” he continues, as if she somehow represented
something we are to think of as abhorrent, while we’re shown footage of various
ethnic minorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “yookay” is a reference to “Yookay Aesthetics”, a
satirical account on X devoted to “chronicling the new Britain AKA ‘the
Yookay’”. It posts images of multicultural Britain — halal butchers, Deliveroo
riders and shops with foreign names all feature. Posts from recent days include
one captioned “Indian man showers in River Thames” (showing a fully dressed man
with his feet in the water) and a notice about a proposed new mosque in Dover.
“Aesthetics account — posts are not implicit value judgments”, the account’s
bio reads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similarly, the documentary never actually says anything
explicitly racist. Instead, it shows us a series of vox pops with people in the
streets of Brixton — four Black, two white — who are asked about British values
and to give their opinions on “Great British heroes” like Alfred the Great,
Lord Nelson and, er, Henry VIII.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But one of the vox pops didn’t go down quite the way GB News
might have hoped. It showed a young, British-born Black man explaining why he
loves Britain but then struggling to respond to what he considers to be British
values — “is it something to do with the cost of living or something?” he asks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’ve plastered this video all over your social media
channels, taking advantage of my autistic older brother for views and to push
your weird anti-black narrative,” his brother posted on X in response to the
clip. “As a news company that <i>should</i> be responsible, this shouldn’t have
been posted but oh well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quite. And I wasn’t the only one to agree. Among those to
call out GB News were one of their own presenters, Martin Daubney, who asked,
“How many white kids would know about Alfred the Great?” (not to mention
adults), and the former leader of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson,
who deemed it “a liberty” (i.e., out of order) and said the interviewee was
“not a problem”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is an astonishing demonstration of the broader cultural
and political shift to the right — not to the traditional, conservative right
but to the far more “based”, vice-signalling, Very Online right — that GB News,
a channel that claims to stand for “the Great British culture of honour”
thought it could get away with this kind of nasty, low-quality content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of this shift is about a backlash to the censoriousness
and identity politics that has dominated culture for several years and that
peaked in 2020. But it is also a product of the fragmentation of the internet
into a series of homogenous silos, particularly since Elon Musk’s takeover of
what was then Twitter — and the mass X-odus of liberals, primarily to Bluesky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spend any time on X and the algorithms will rapidly serve
you up a whole slew of content aimed at stirring up hatred — often along racial
or religious lines. It is a depressing experience. And the problem is that
precisely because of how awful so much of it is, those who consider it as such
aren’t around to call it out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems unthinkable to me that this “documentary” would
have come out even three years ago; the nastiest part of the right has become
hugely emboldened. And while these might be new online echo chambers, what they
are peddling is simply old-fashioned racism and bigotry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What the world got wrong about tariffs Extract</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the beginning of the year, the world was in striking
agreement on one point: if Donald Trump went ahead with tariffs, it would
strengthen the dollar and trigger stagflation. Chief executives, investors and
commentators all said the same. Economists estimated that every percentage
point increase in the tariff rate would shave 0.1 per cent off US growth and
add 0.1 per cent to inflation. But so far, the consequences have been far less
disruptive than just about anyone expected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some analysts still think that’s because Trump’s threats
have been mostly posturing. But the effective US tariff rate has already risen
from 2.5 per cent to 15 per cent. Tariff revenue is rolling in at an annual
rate above $300bn, roughly four times the pace this time last year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many economists had assumed that, by lowering imports,
tariffs would strengthen the dollar almost automatically, as an accounting
identity. Instead, it suffered its worst fall over the first half of a year
since the early 1970s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This unexpected turn is now attributed to the fact that the
dollar started the year historically overvalued. Many foreigners were heavily
exposed to dollar assets. Of late, they have been hedging those risks and
investing more outside the US. Many countries are increasingly attractive
places to park money, in part because tariff threats inspired them to push
economic reform and cut trade deals with non-US partners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bigger mystery is why the stagflationary impact of
tariffs has yet to materialise in the aggregate data. Is the US really enjoying
a free lunch, taking in $300bn a year in tariff revenues with none of the
expected heartburn? By some estimates, foreign exporters are indeed absorbing
20 per cent of the costs — a much larger share than they did in response to
tariffs in Trump’s first term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The remaining 80 per cent, however, is still getting paid in
roughly equal shares by US corporations and consumers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The likely answer is that the negative economic effect of
tariffs is being countered by other forces, including the mania for artificial
intelligence and more government stimulus. Since January, estimates of what the
big tech companies will spend this year on building out AI infrastructure have
risen $60bn to $350bn. Smaller businesses are scrambling to catch the wave too,
further boosting growth. And all this excitement is neutralising the fear that
trade policy uncertainty would dampen animal spirits and freeze new capex.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>AI-driven bullishness is also lifting growth by keeping
financial conditions loose, even with higher interest rates. According to a new
index from the Federal Reserve, those conditions would be neutral, not loose,
were it not for the stock market, which has continued rising this year due
largely to AI stocks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, the promise of tax relief makes it easier for US
corporations to absorb a larger than expected share of the tariff costs, rather
than pass it all on to consumers. Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is expected to
save US businesses around $100bn this year and more than that in 2026, mainly
in tax breaks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is not to say tariffs have no negative economic effect.
The costs are in fact starting to show up in higher prices for major household
appliances, sporting goods and toys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet the overall inflation rate has been held in check by
falling rents and prices for other kinds of goods, including used cars and
energy. And those prices are declining for reasons unrelated to tariffs;
used-car prices are still retreating from highs created by supply disruptions
during the pandemic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So economists were not entirely wrong about the tariffs. And
stagflation may yet materialise, particularly if the average effective rate
continues to climb. But so far even a much higher rate has not been enough to
overwhelm the larger forces sustaining growth and containing inflation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a way what we are seeing is a replay of 2023. That year,
too, many expected a big shock (then mainly from Fed rate rises) to
dramatically slow US growth, only to find the impact offset by the AI spending
boom and the US government’s seemingly bottomless capacity to keep doling out
fiscal support.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What the world got wrong, then and now, starts with its
mental frameworks. The timeworn mistake of employing simple models, in which a
headline-grabbing input A leads in a straight line to outcome B, has been
greatly magnified by the global obsession with Trump. He is the only input
anyone cares to analyse anymore. But complex economies are rarely shaped by
just one factor, not even a shock as big as Trump’s trade policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The coming cryptocurrency CTISIS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=411 src="FT_files/image021.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My heart sank last week when I read that JPMorgan Chase was
looking into lending against clients’ cryptocurrency holdings, even though we
all knew the day was coming when crypto would make its way into the real
economy. Bitcoin, one of the digital assets banks may lend against, has been
nearly four times as volatile as major indices since 2020. It has also had ties
to terror funding, and I have yet to read anything that made me think it is
more than a tool for speculators and criminals. But that hardly matters when
the largest political donors are behind it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crypto political action committees have, over the last
several years, spent tens of millions of dollars donating to not only
Republican politicians but many Democrats too. This effort culminated a couple
of weeks ago in the passage of the Genius Act. Legislation covering other
crypto assets is expected later this year. I predict all this will not only
cause the next financial crisis, but fuel even more political populism and
unrest in the US.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s all too reminiscent of 2000, when advocates for
over-the-counter derivatives descended on Washington begging to be properly
“regulated” so that they could gift the world with financial “innovation.” What
we got instead was a seven-fold increase in poorly regulated credit default
swaps that culminated in the great financial crisis of 2008.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now consider that US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent
expects the stablecoin market to grow tenfold over the next few years, from a
near-$200bn to a $2tn industry, one that will be embedded in everything from
loan underwriting to Treasury markets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Democrat Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the
Senate banking commission, told me last week: “We’ve seen this movie before,”
with lobbyists “saying, ‘Please regulate us’ because they want the gold sticker
of government confirmation that they are a ‘safe’ investment,” and politicians
offering up bipartisan support for deregulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, you can draw a clear line from derivatives
deregulation in 2000, and the broader Clinton era deregulation that eroded the
barriers between trading and lending, to the weakening of Dodd Frank regulation
for regional banks in 2018 (which contributed to the banking crisis of 2023),
and now, the Genius Act. All of it was bipartisan. Warren, who was brought to
power by voters who felt betrayed by mainstream politicians of both stripes,
waged an unsuccessful campaign to convince Democrats not to go along with
Republican support for the Genius Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But money talks, and the crypto lobby has already shown
tremendous power by spending $40mn to defeat critics like Sherrod Brown of
Ohio, the former Senate Banking chair. While almost two-thirds of Senate
Democrats voted against the Genius Act, the proponents—including influential
Democratic senators like Virginia's Mark Warner and New York’s Kirsten
Gillibrand—were enough for the legislation to pass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This worries me for four reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, the Genius Act (like the Commodity Futures
Modernization Act of 2000) is being marketed as a way to make crypto safer,
with stablecoins backed one to one by US dollars. But that doesn’t make what
is, more broadly, a volatile asset class any less volatile. Indeed, it may only
make the overall market more so. Advocates talk about cryptocurrencies such as
bitcoin as a hedge against traditional markets, but in fact, bitcoin is a “high
beta” investment, meaning that it is highly correlated to the stock market.
That means that both gains and losses relative to the S&amp;P are amplified.
Anything over a beta of one indicates a higher volatility than the market. A
recent Fidelity report found bitcoin’s rolling 3-year beta to the S&amp;P was
2.6.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, I can’t imagine a worse moment to encourage
financial “innovation” than when markets, economics and monetary policy are so
uncertain. Consider what could happen if, over the coming months or years, the
Fed must raise interest rates more sharply due to inflation. Markets would
tank, as they always do when rates go up. Crypto would fall further and faster.
Financial institutions (including any number of shadow banks) holding crypto on
their balance sheets could then run into trouble, causing credit markets to
freeze. Suddenly, we're facing echoes of 2008.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enter my third worry. Genius Act proponents say it will
support the dollar and the Treasury market. But one could easily imagine a
flight to safety into which crypto companies like, say, Tether (which has more
US Treasury holdings than Germany) must sell T-bills into a down market to
cover redemptions. Then you’ve got a fire sale, higher borrowing costs, and yet
another disastrous situation in which Main Street is under pressure to bail out
speculators.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this time, it comes after more than two decades of
growing cynicism with politics. This gets me to my final worry. Financial
deregulation from the late 1990s under the Clinton administration set the stage
for both 2008 and a loss of working people’s support for Democrats. That in
turn set the stage for Trump’s rise. Trump has now set the stage for our next
financial crisis by backing (and of course, trading) crypto. What happens when
we get financial chaos and more voter cynicism about mainstream politics at a
time when there is less interest or ability for the government to buffer a
downturn? No coin, and nothing stable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The answer to UK stagnation IS Staring us in the face</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we are told on a daily if not hourly basis, the source of
all our political, public service and economic woes is the lack of economic
growth. The economic potential of the majority of the British people who don’t
live in Greater London is overlooked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 2008 financial crisis hit the UK particularly hard
because our economy was so centred on finance. The Conservatives responded with
the economic equivalent of leeches — sustained austerity. The result has been
the slow strangulation of the economy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under these profound policy mistakes lies a multi-decade
failure to foster geographically even economic growth. From a productivity and
GDP per head perspective we are two nations: Greater London and the Southeast,
and everywhere else. This means there is a huge opportunity to improve
productivity and output. Even small increases in productivity beyond London and
the Southeast would break the stranglehold of stagnation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GDP per head in the UK averages just over £39,000. Every
region is below that except the Southeast at £41,000 and London at a whopping
£69,000. My region, the Northeast, is the lowest at £28,000, despite having
world-leading companies and research institutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We see the same disparities when we look at labour
productivity, which is also indirectly a measure of capital investment both
physical and human. At 86 per cent of the national average per head, the
Northeast’s has barely changed in two decades. If we could just lift that GDP
to the national average it would increase UK GDP by 1.14 per cent — almost the
same GDP growth for the entire country in 2024. If we could do the same for the
next lowest region — Wales — that would add a further 1.2 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That picture is reflected across the country. If the Tories
had matched their talk of levelling up with action on regional productivity and
per capita GDP we could have had healthy economic growth for every year but the
Covid year of 2020 and 2023, which followed Liz Truss’s economic disruption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are some hard truths embedded in this data. First, a
London-centred approach to economic policy cannot bring back healthy growth for
the nation. Second, the gross inequality in economic output is a consequence of
decades of under-investment elsewhere and can only be addressed by smart
strategic investment and effective public-private co-operation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, investment has to mean science and technology. In our
enquiry into regional innovation and growth, the select committee has taken
wide-ranging evidence. From the education and skilling of the workforce, to
technology and capital deployment in businesses, start ups and spin outs, to
lab facilities and “catapult” tech centres, to internet and transport
connectivity, disparities need to be addressed. That means building on the
existing business and technology strengths of the diverse regions, and, in particular,
mayors. Working with regional governments must take up this agenda. And it must
begin with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology — but not end
there. Lifting productivity must be a co-ordinated project across government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Labour has inherited a destructive legacy of stagnation and
regional underdevelopment. It has made some, limited, progress, increasing
investment in science and transport and extending devolution. Unfortunately, my
committee’s work has also revealed an enduring complacency and lack of regional
lens in many Whitehall departments. If that parochialism is left undisturbed we
will remain two countries when it comes to productivity and output — suffering
economic stagnation while staring at the solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The truly scary thing about the Coldplay concert scandal</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=429 src="FT_files/image022.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You know what’s really interesting about this Coldplay
couple story,’ a colleague said to me the other day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I very much doubted I would know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were speaking nearly a week after Andy Byron, the chief
executive of tech company Astronomer, was caught on a giant video screen at a
Coldplay concert in Boston with his arms around a woman who was a) his head of
HR and b) not his wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Byron had by then been a top-trending Google topic from
Australia to Albania and it seemed unlikely there was anything compelling left
to say about him. But my colleague made a good point: for those of us who deal
with the vast corporate PR industrial complex, it was notable to watch a top
executive fall so comprehensively that no amount of fudging obfuscation could
save him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That would make it unusual in a world where media enquiries
about corporate impropriety, no matter how well based, are often met with a “no
comment’, a huffy denial or a threat of legal action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s been like this for years, as a lay-off strewn news
industry continues to confront a far more buoyant public relations sector. In
the US alone there were nearly five PR people for every journalist in 2013 and
by some counts, the ratio has since widened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are, of course, a lot of decent PR professionals and
yes, journalists have long been among the least trusted people. Though a 2024
global survey does suggest we are doing better than politicians and are level
with bankers and, as it happens, business leaders. This improvement is welcome
because the Coldplay affair underlines another critical point: the need for
robust journalism in an age of rampant and grimly effective fake social media
“news”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the most notable aspects of the incident was the
spread of fabricated online statements purporting to be from those involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contrary to what you might have read (and may still
believe), Byron did not say he found it troubling that “what should have been a
private moment became public without my consent”. His wife did not post a
tearful statement about the scandal. Coldplay did not say it would now have
camera-free audience sections for people and their “sidepieces”. And the
red-faced woman filmed standing next to the couple was not another Astronomer
employee named Alyssa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This avalanche of online tripe was so gigantic that
Astronomer had to address it head-on. “Alyssa Stoddard was not at the event and
no other employees were in the video,” it said in a statement. “Andy Byron has
not put out any statement, reports saying otherwise are all incorrect.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alas, this came too late for some newspapers, which reported
Byron’s statement as fact. On the upside, proper news outlets corrected the
error. But don’t expect that from the hoaxers, nor the social media sites that
hosted their nonsense. And here is the serious point. Coldplay-gate doubtless
caused hurt for those at the centre of it and their families. But so far, the
hoaxes it spurred have been relatively harmless compared with the plethora of
online scams that continue to go unchecked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just in the EU, the latest figures show internet fraudsters
swindled people out of €4.3bn in 2022. Since then there has been an explosion
of AI tools that help scammers make cheap and convincing fake videos of
financial experts to lure consumers into making dodgy investments or disclosing
data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Social media companies insist they remove adverts for this
rot and try to stay ahead of the fakers. But as my colleague Martin Wolf wrote
after discovering his identity had been faked, it is hard to believe tech
giants, with all their resources, cannot do better. The same goes for all the
other unfettered online harm. Some governments are trying to legislate, notably
in the EU. The Coldplay couple — and the misleading maelstrom that followed
their exposure — are a reminder more need to join them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Time for Britain to rethink aversion to the super-CEO</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=346 height=471 src="FT_files/image023.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HSBC is struggling to find a replacement for chair Mark
Tucker, pictured. A relatable problem, probably, to many British boards. BP
just named a new chair; Prudential seeks one too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finding the right balance of experience and availability can
be a real chore. Yet, if HSBC were based on the other side of the Atlantic,
there might be a simple solution: give the job to the chief executive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nothing provokes pearl-clutching among UK investors and
governance watchers as much as the idea of combining the chair and CEO roles.
It’s simply not the done thing. Shareholder advisory service ISS calls it “a
serious breach of good practice” given the chair’s importance in keeping the
chief in check.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The UK’s corporate governance code asks companies to comply
with the principle of separating the two jobs, or explain. Almost all comply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Americans aren't fully convinced. About two-fifths of
S&amp;P 500 companies combine the two roles, including six of the biggest 10 by
market capitalisation. And while the number is falling, shareholders still
don’t seem to care much. This year, companies fielded 31 proposals to split the
CEO and chair role, down from 44 in 2024, according to Freshfields. Not one
received majority support; the average vote was 31 per cent in favour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Supreme leaders are a recipe for misfortune. But separate
chairs aren't the only way to hold the CEO’s feet to the fire. JPMorgan, like
nearly two-thirds of S&amp;P 500 companies that combine the jobs according to
the Conference Board/ESGAUGE, argues this is the role of the lead independent
director, whose job is to act as a liaison for shareholders and generally check
the board is running as it ought to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having an independent chair is no guarantee of a
well-behaved CEO either, as Tesla has amply shown. Putting too much emphasis on
the chair risks turning down the volume on the other members of the board, who
ought to be acting collectively to keep the company on track.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Better to have directors who are, say, tasked with making
annual site visits and reporting back to the board than one strong personality
who provides much of the impetus while others nod along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now is a good time for the UK to question long-held views.
The pressure is on to attract companies lured by US markets, where valuations
are higher and governance rules more flexible. Good governance should always
command a premium, but the idea that splitting CEO and chair roles is
sufficient — or really necessary — deserves debate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>EU’s budget is setting it up for geopolitical
marginalisation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Earlier in July, the European Commission fired the starting
gun on a 30-month marathon negotiation on the EU’s next seven-year budget.
Brussels has proposed a nearly €2tn common spending pot it claims faces up to
Europe’s “new and emerging challenges”. Does it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, the good. Brussels has taken some steps towards
reallocating funds to today’s priorities: infrastructure, defence, security,
research and energy and industrial resilience. The exact numbers are already
the subject of fights, even inside the commission itself. But just as important
is the lack of controversy around the methodological changes to the budget.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The commission rolls agricultural subsidies and transfers to
poorer regions into new national plans, to be proposed by governments, approved
by the EU and checked against delivery to release funding. This marks a major
shift, modelled on the post-pandemic recovery fund. Grumbles can be heard about
insufficient funding and a power grab by national governments from local
officials. But not about the basic principle of cash in return for
demonstrable, mutually agreed reforms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is a quiet revolution from the habit of simply sending
checks to farmers and local governments; the most remarkable thing about the
budget draft was the least remarked upon. Another change seemingly received
without objection is the streamlining of the budget into fewer funding streams.
This simplification should speed up disbursement and ease planning and
co-ordination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, the bad. The commission has reprioritised its budget
with a view to the changing geopolitical landscape. The commission’s new
spending priorities show it has listened to warnings in the Enrico Letta and
Mario Draghi reports. But it has missed the opportunity to integrate budget
politics more closely with strategic calls to unify the single market and boost
productivity. A case in point is the ill-judged idea of lump-sum taxes on EU
companies with large turnover. Brussels is right to seek new revenue sources.
But any business levy should be designed within its planned pan-EU corporate
code. Getting a share of the corporate tax base from companies choosing this
regime is better than slapping a new tax on top of existing ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The budget also fails to address the need for more equity
funding for companies in key strategic sectors, set out convincingly in a
report by the European Policy Centre that proposes an off-budget instrument
resembling an EU sovereign wealth fund making equity investments in the bloc.
This is a good idea. So is the EPC’s call to securitise EU-funded common
European industrial and infrastructure projects. Both would boost the growth of
badly needed pan-EU capital markets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A third weakness is the commission’s lack of attention to
providing investors with pan-EU safe benchmark securities. The budget draft
does nothing to promote this. More common debt is a politically explosive idea.
But it need not be raised for subsidising poorer members; a stronger
justification is to fund an EU sovereign wealth fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, the ugly. Brussels commits the statistical sin of
using nominal numbers, which mainly reflect inflation, to claim a large
increase in the budget. The relevant measure of resources is the share of gross
national income the budget allocates to common priorities. The last budget came
to a little over 1 per cent of EU GNI. Adding in the special post-pandemic
debt-financed fund, the total came to 1.7 per cent. The new draft budget is for
1.26 per cent of GNI, but after deducting the money needed to pay down common
debts, it’s a mere 1.15 per cent — an amount that will be further whittled down
in talks. A proposal to spend one-third less of an already tiny share of
resources makes a mockery of all the strategic evangelising. This is a budget
that ensures continued geopolitical marginalisation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the great American philosophers Ralph Waldo Emerson and
Omar Little have argued, if you “come at the king, you best not miss”. If the
EU wants to hold its own in world affairs, it must give itself the resources
for it. Getting more success is more likely for off-budget ideas such as the
EPC’s, common borrowing for a sovereign wealth fund and a delay to paying down
existing debt to free up funds. Both EU and national leaders accept they face
unprecedented, perhaps existential, risks. They must now admit those cannot be
addressed on the cheap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>EU must defend its car safety standards</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The recent agreement between Japan and the US to suspend
vehicle safety requirements for US-made cars is a deeply alarming precedent
(“Washington and Tokyo agree 15% tariff deal”, Report, July 24).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to reports, Japan will now allow the import of
American-market vehicles without requiring them to meet its domestic safety
testing or standards. In exchange, the US will reduce tariffs on Japanese
vehicle exports.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is no trade victory — it sets a dangerous precedent:
trading away road safety for short-term political gain. Europe must not follow
suit. As the FT reports, the EU and US are now close to finalising a trade deal
(“Washington and Brussels close in on trade agreement in tariff ‘shakedown’”,
Report, July 24).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If it includes so-called “equivalence” or “mutual
recognition” of vehicles, it would repeat Japan’s mistake — and expose European
road users to lower safety standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in May, the commission appeared to take a strong line.
The FT reported that Brussels would hold firm on vehicle safety rules despite
US pressure (“EU threatens levy on cars if talks fail”, Report, May 9).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A senior official stated that EU safety standards were not
up for negotiation. The commission must now hold this line — and not give in at
the final hurdle. The safety gap remains stark: EU regulations require
life-saving technologies such as automated emergency braking, intelligent speed
assistance and pedestrian protection requirements — none of which are mandatory
on American vehicles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU’s General Safety Regulation for new vehicles, in
force since July 2024, is expected to save thousands of lives over the years to
come. Brussels must defend it in all trade negotiations — and ensure the public
understands what is at stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>News of a revised tariff rate on all exports from Cambodia

global trade war”, Report, FT.com, July 11) should not be interpreted as a
victory by the political elite in Phnom Penh, but as a wake-up call for the Hun
regime to invest and put Cambodia on a new economic trajectory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The regime has had three months to negotiate a deal that
would protect Cambodian citizens from the effects of these proposed levies, and
to introduce reforms that will better shield the country from future economic
shocks. On both counts it has failed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I call on the regime to firstly prioritise safeguarding
low-income borrowers and at-risk workers in rural, small and medium-sized
enterprises. Second it must modernise the country’s education system, so we
have a workforce fit for the future; and, last, it must tear down social
barriers, so that women have the same opportunities as men to take up

<p class=MsoNormal>Reforms that build greater resilience in the Cambodian

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Arbitrage trade best suited to long-only investors</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alpha opportunities in the sustainability-linked bond market
are not novel (“The easy money trades lurking in the sustainable debt market”,
Moral Money, FT.com, July 18). A landmark case occurred three years ago, when
Poland’s state-controlled oil and gas company PKN Orlen and its
zloty-denominated linkers triggered a coupon “step-up” (an issuer penalty)
following an unexpected downgrade to its ESG rating. Yet bond prices remained
unresponsive to the step-up, and local investors seemed indifferent to what resembled
an “arbitrage” opportunity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is, indeed, an alpha opportunity in such instances,
but not necessarily a pure arbitrage. These trades are better suited to active,
institutional, long-only investors who can integrate them into their
portfolios. The canonical arbitrageur, referred to by Simon Mundy earlier in
his article and widely assumed to be omnipresent by proponents of efficient
markets, simply has no jurisdiction here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Corporate credit investing is comparatively inefficient: it
requires upfront cash, offers limited leverage, and is not eminently liquid,
with wide bid-ask spreads due to its fragmented over-the-counter nature. For an
arbitrageur, any pricing anomaly must be sufficiently large to overcome these
frictions and to justify the cost of the capital tied up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moreover, such opportunities typically take time to converge
(“weeks”, per the article). This therefore requires arbitrageurs to warehouse
risk on their balance sheets for longer periods than they may be accustomed to,
additionally limiting their ability to redeploy capital across markets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, there are often additional risk dimensions. In the
PKN Orlen case, for example, currency risk added another layer of complexity;
additional risks must either be hedged or absorbed, further deterring pure
arbitrageurs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hence, while sustainability-linked bonds may sometimes
exhibit pricing dislocations, it would be remiss to assume that sophisticated
arbitrageurs are simply overlooking them. These opportunities are best
understood as incremental yield, available to investors already underwriting
comparable underlying risks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hence, it is active, institutional, long-only asset managers
that are best positioned to harvest such mispricings when they align with their
core strategies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Here’s why US capacity to supply Ukraine isn’t infinite</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=382 height=643 src="FT_files/image024.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The editorial “Trump’s overdue pivot on Ukraine” (FT View,
July 21) captures the excitement in Europe at the opportunity to leverage
President Donald Trump’s apparent shift towards supplying Ukraine with more US
munitions. But expectations on both sides of the Atlantic should be tempered by
reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a single recent Russian strike on July 9, Ukraine was
attacked with 728 Shahed-style drones, seven cruise missiles, and six ballistic
missiles. The US currently produces just about 600 Patriot interceptor missiles
per year — fewer than were needed to defend against that single attack if the
system was relied on exclusively. There is no surge capacity left. Expanding
production isn’t a matter of flipping a switch; it’s a years- or even
decades-long process involving labour shortages, strained supply chains, and
complex component bottlenecks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Worse, Ukraine is only one of the regions clamouring for
these munitions. US forces require interceptors for their own operational needs
in the Middle East and Asia, where the threat from Iranian and Chinese missile
stockpiles remains a significant challenge. At a certain point, transfers will
stop — not because of politics, but because there simply won’t be any missiles
left to send regardless of who’s paying for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ukraine is developing its own drone interceptors and
receiving other systems from allies, which helps alleviate over-reliance on
limited US supplies. But these can’t compensate for the scale and reliability
of US platforms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If Europe wants to chart a long-term path to stability, it
must reckon with these hard limits. America is overextended in an increasingly
unstable world, and its capacity to support this war is not infinite.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A wake-up call for all those monolingual Anglo-Saxons</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Simon Kuper struck a chord in his thoughtful piece “AI is
reinforcing the dominance of English in the workplace” (Work &amp; Careers,
July 21).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a Londoner, who studied French and German, I fully agree
with his thesis, but would add a couple more points.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Native monolingual Anglo-Saxons are at a disadvantage. They
will lack the experience of operating in a foreign language and having to adapt
to a foreign culture. Working in the City of London surrounded by those for
whom English is at best a second language, daily reminds me that we
Anglo-Saxons do ourselves no favours. We often speak in ways that make us, at
times, near incomprehensible to non-native speakers. Speed of diction, choice
of vocabulary, obscure expressions compound to confuse good communication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moreover, the cultural awareness derived from having to
immerse oneself in the mannerisms and traditions of another civilisation opens
the mind and sharpens interpersonal skills. While Stem (science, technology,
engineering and mathematics) subjects are critical, it is foolish to ignore the
study of languages that offers an extraordinary insight into human
communications and culture, while at the same time developing critical
analytical faculties. These have certainly contributed to my own long career in
finance. Moreover, the multilingual young professional will outcompete the
monolingual Brit in the jobs market, all other things being equal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So yes, being fluent in English is important for non-native
speakers, but the Anglo-Saxons still need to invest in linguistic skills,
including maybe more Arabic, Chinese and or other Asian languages for future
use. However, the statistics do not look good. Language study across the UK is
falling fast. This is really not a good thing for UK people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Acceptance of 15% baseline levy follows months of failure to
follow through on retaliation threats</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By Andy Bounds (Brussels), Henry Foy (Turnberry), Ben Hall
(London)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the face of Donald Trump’s trade blitz, the EU began its
path to capitulation on April 10.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sweeping “liberation day” tariffs the US president
inflicted on most of the world earlier that month sent financial markets into a
tailspin over recession fears. Trump blinked and on April 9 dropped the tariffs
to 10 per cent, in what he said was a temporary measure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Brussels blinked too. On April 10, it suspended
retaliatory tariffs and accepted the US offer of talks with a knife at its
throat: 10 per cent tariffs on most of its trade, along with higher levies on
steel, aluminium and vehicles. Rather than join Canada and China with instant
retaliation, the EU chose compromise, hoping to secure a better deal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under the framework deal struck by European Commission
president Ursula von der Leyen and Trump at his Turnberry golf resort on
Sunday, the EU has swallowed a broad-based “baseline” US tariff of 15 per cent,
including crucially for cars, but not for steel, which will be subject to a
quota system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relief among policymakers about avoiding an immediate
transatlantic trade war was tinged with regret: could the EU, the world’s
largest trading bloc, have extracted better terms had it not pulled its punches
early on?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s the bully in the schoolyard and we didn’t join others
in standing up to him,” said one diplomat. “Those who don’t hang together get
hanged separately.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Georg Riekeles, a former commission official who helped
negotiate the UK’s exit from the bloc, said the EU’s recent threat to apply
€93bn of retaliatory tariffs against US goods came too late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“With the benefit of hindsight, the EU would have been
better off answering the US vigorously in April in a one-two combo with China’s
retaliation against the US tariff hikes, which left markets and Trump reeling,”
said Riekeles of the European Policy Centre think-tank.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump views the EU as a parasite, feeding off the lucrative
US market while closing its own through regulation and standards. The US
president has said the union was “formed to screw the US” and “nastier than
China”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU’s response to his re-election was flat-footed. Months
of planning beforehand by a dedicated team, which included senior trade
officials led by another Brexit talks veteran Sabine Weyand and von der Leyen’s
trade adviser, Tomas Baert, went up in smoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They drew up a three-point plan modelled on the approach
taken in Trump’s first term: offer to reduce the near €200bn goods trade
deficit by buying more liquefied natural gas, weapons, and agricultural
products. Second, offer mutual tariff reductions on each other’s goods. If that
failed, they would prepare retaliation and rely on a market response to a
possible trade war, or increasing inflation in the US, to force Trump to back
down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Trump by March had levied 25 per cent tariffs on steel,
aluminium and cars. At a meeting in Luxembourg that month, many trade ministers
were on the war path.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Germany, France and a few others pushed for the commission
to consult on using its new “trade bazooka”, the anti-coercion instrument.
Designed after Trump’s first term to counter trade policy being used to
pressure governments over other matters, it would allow Brussels to bar US
companies from public tenders, revoke intellectual property protection and
restrict imports and exports.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, it was not clear a majority of member states agreed
with the move, diplomats said. Weyand told EU ambassadors to show “strategic
patience”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the UK struck a trade deal with Washington in May,
accepting Trump’s 10 per cent baseline tariff, it encouraged those EU member
states seeking a settlement, especially Berlin. A severe tit-for-tat escalation
between the US and China ended in partial détente, easing investor fears of
global trade turmoil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and German Chancellor
Friedrich Merz for months held onto the EU’s early offer to drop all industrial
tariffs if the US did the same, even though Washington had long made clear it
wanted unilateral concessions. Berlin was preoccupied with obtaining a
complicated “offset” scheme to provide tariff relief for European — in
practice, German — car companies that manufactured and exported from the US.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While EU technocrats were boxing under Queensberry rules,
Trump was in a New York street fight. Maros Sefcovié, the EU’s trade
commissioner, was dispatched to Washington seven times to propose areas of
agreement, deliver homilies on the importance of the transatlantic
relationship, and promote Germany’s car offset scheme. In total, Sefcovié held
more than 100 hours of talks with his US counterparts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A deal for a permanent 10 per cent “reciprocal” tariff,
hatched in July with US trade representative Jamieson Greer and commerce
secretary Howard Lutnick, was flatly rejected by Trump, who instead threatened
to raise levies on the EU to 30 per cent, rather than 20 per cent, from August.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His threats had worked before. The retaliatory package the
EU paused in April had been reduced from €26bn to €21bn after lobbying by
France, Ireland and Italy to ensure bourbon was removed from the list, after
Trump threatened to hit European distillers. If everything member states
requested had been removed, only €9bn of goods would have been left on the
list, officials told the FT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over the months of talks, Sefcovié’s phone rang regularly
with ministers urging caution. Simon Harris, trade minister of Ireland, wanted
to save the country’s pharmaceutical, spirits and beef industry from any US
counter-punch and let the world — not least the Americans — know with frequent
social media posts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Business leaders also called loudly for restraint,
preferring to accept a cut to profit margins than risk punitive tariffs that
would hit sales. A second package of retaliatory tariffs on the US was cut to
€72bn before being approved on July 24 to be used if talks collapsed, bringing
the total to €93bn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The months-long uncertainty over the direction of
negotiations has also exposed divisions inside the commission itself. Weyand,
whose hardball approach to Brexit often outfoxed her UK counterparts, argued
for a stronger stance towards Trump and the use of the EU’s retaliation tools,
in opposition to the more dovish von der Leyen, multiple diplomats and
officials told the FT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The French government, notwithstanding its attempts to
shield its businesses from retaliation, also repeatedly called for a more
muscular approach. But the commission president and her aides argued the
potential damage from additional Trump measures — including threats to impose
tariffs on sectors such as EU pharmaceuticals — meant the risk of a spiralling
trade war was too great.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was also concern a more confrontational stance towards
Washington could spill over into other areas. Europe’s dependency on America’s
security guarantee was a further argument against trade confrontation,
especially for the bloc’s eastern and northern members. Fears that Trump would
cut off weapons supplies to Ukraine, pull troops out of Europe or even quit
Nato overshadowed the talks, diplomats said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A further priority for the commission president was to
preserve the EU’s right to regulate. The US tech industry has pushed hard for
Trump to pressure the EU to weaken laws regulating online speech and data
management. They also opposed national digital taxes. So far, von der Leyen has
refused to compromise on those issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Some in the commission’s trade directorate viewed this as a
classical trade dispute and were pushing for retaliation, but von der Leyen had
to consider the bigger picture which drove her caution and risk aversion,” said
Mujtaba Rahman, Europe managing director at Eurasia Group, the risk
consultancy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Trump rebuffed the deal hatched by his own officials,
the commission’s negotiating team concluded they had no option but to accept a
US tariff of 15 per cent. They pitched the number to member state ambassadors
this week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Officials will try to present it as a status quo deal, since
the 15 per cent theoretically includes the pre-existing average US tariff of
4.8 per cent. But on a trade-weighted basis, the pre-existing US tariff on
imports from the EU was only 1.6 per cent. There was no hiding the fact that
the EU was rolled over by the Trump juggernaut, said one ambassador. “Trump
worked out exactly where our pain threshold is.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>FT Reporters</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Germany and France yesterday hit out at the EU’s
long-awaited trade deal with the US, warning that it would wound the European
economy as the euro slid against the dollar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the agreement
concluded with US President Donald Trump the day before would cause
“considerable damage” to his country, Europe and the US itself. “Not only will
there be a higher inflation rate, but it will also affect transatlantic trade
overall,” Merz said, in a striking rebuke of the deal negotiated by European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The euro was down more than 1 per cent against the dollar
and fell 0.8 per cent against the pound, following the announcement on Sunday
that the US would impose 15 per cent tariffs on most imports from the EU.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This result cannot satisfy us,” Merz added. “But it was the
best result achievable in a given situation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said the deal marked a
“dark day,” adding that the EU had “resigned itself into submission.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The agreement, hailed by Von der Leyen as “the biggest trade
deal ever” and covering nearly 44 per cent of global GDP, averted a possible
transatlantic trade war. It secured a lower tariff rate for the EU than the 30
per cent that Trump had threatened to impose from August 1. But the duties
still mark a threefold increase from the average tariffs imposed on the bloc by
the US before Trump’s “liberation day” announcements in April.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Germany's Dax closed 1.1 per cent lower yesterday while
France’s Cac 40 gave up 0.4 per cent and tariff-exposed car industry stocks on
the region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.8 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the euro fell yesterday, it remains 12 per cent higher
against the dollar for the year, boosted by Germany’s defence spending plans as
well as broader investor hopes that Trump’s America First policies will
encourage a wave of economic stimulus in the EU.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bloc’s steel producers’ industry body said a 15 per cent
tariff on most exports would add a “huge burden” on its members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The US Chamber of Commerce in the EU said the deal “provides
relief” to businesses. But it added that the 15 per cent tariff rate “still
marks a significant increase in the cost of trading” and that more sectors
should be included in the agreement's zero-for-zero tariffs list.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The White House said the deal “achieves historic structural
reforms and strategic commitments that will benefit American industry, workers
and national security for generations.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Europe's leaders reacted, Spanish premier Pedro Sanchez
said he supported it “without enthusiasm.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>French and German far-right parties said the deal exposed EU
weakness. Alice Weidel, co-leader of Alternative for Germany, said it was “not
an agreement but a slap in the face to European consumers and producers!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reactions came as Trump and UK premier Sir Keir Starmer met
at the US president's Turnberry golf club in Scotland to discuss Britain’s
trade deal with the US, and wars in Ukraine and Gaza.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump said he planned to set a tariff of up to 20 per cent
“for essentially the rest of the world,” referring to nations that have not
struck agreements with the US. He would unveil pharmaceuticals tariffs “in the
near future.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Details of the deal: What Washington and Brussels have
agreed</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU and US agreed a trade deal that will hit most
European imports with a 15 per cent tariff and require the bloc to invest
hundreds of billions of euros into American energy products and weapons in
order to avoid a trade war. But though the EU has avoided the 30 per cent
tariff rate threatened by President Donald Trump, it still leaves US tariffs at
their highest level in decades.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What will be covered by tariffs?<br>
The 15 per cent tariff will cover about 70 per cent of EU exports, including
pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, which had not been subject to levies
before. The rate also applies to cars, which had been subject to a 27.5 per
cent tariff ahead of the deal. This totals about €780bn worth of trade, said
the European Commission. US imports into the EU will not face higher tariffs in
return. Germany, which pushed for low tariffs on cars and pharmaceuticals,
welcomed the deal as “acceptable” under tough negotiating circumstances, said
one official. German economy minister Katherina Reiche said the agreement was
“challenging for our economy” but that it was “important that some sectors have
been excluded”. Officials in France—the EU’s biggest agricultural
producer—digested the impact of opening the market to more US agricultural
products. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou described the accord as capitulation,
saying it was a “dark day” for the bloc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about steel and aluminium?<br>
Trump said on Sunday the US would maintain a 50 per cent tariff on steel and
aluminium imports. EU officials said yesterday the two sides had agreed to a
quota based on historic import levels, above which the 50 per cent rate would
apply. But US officials said while a lower tariff quota was being discussed,
nothing had yet been agreed. “They tried to include steel, and the president
said no, you know, he’s not willing to put steel into this deal. And they
accepted that,” an official said. “There are still a variety of things they can
add to the agreement over time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Which sectors will have zero tariffs?<br>
The two sides agreed they would both cut tariffs to zero on about €70bn of
trade. This included “all aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals,
certain generics . . . certain agricultural products, natural resources, and
critical raw materials,” said commission president Ursula von der Leyen. It was
unclear whether wine and spirits would be included in the tariff-free part of
the deal. Negotiations continue. The zero-tariff preferential treatment for the
US could run counter to World Trade Organization rules, trade experts have
warned. “All of these methods are clearly not WTO-compatible, but it would not
be the first case,” said Ignacio Garcia Bercero, a former EU trade official who
led on WTO rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What has the EU promised to buy?<br>
As part of the deal, the EU has pledged to buy $750bn worth of US energy
products, including gas, oil and nuclear fuel, EU officials have said. This
would amount to $250bn per year for the rest of Trump’s term, von der Leyen
said, marking a significant increase in US energy imports by the bloc. In 2024,
the EU imported €375.9bn worth of energy products from all over the world.
Total US energy exports to the EU accounted for about €75bn last year,
according to Eurostat. The commission has also committed to investing $600bn
into the US economy, as well as to undefined amounts of weapons purchases. But
the EU has no legal power to make these pledges, which is why they were “not
legal commitments”, one EU official said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What happens next?<br>
The EU and US will issue a joint statement on August 1, which will outline the
main elements of the deal. EU officials expect Trump to then sign an executive
order that will enact the 15 per cent rate. Brussels will then have to
translate the joint statement into legally binding terms, which will require
the backing of a majority of EU countries. If the deal falls apart, which
diplomats have said is unlikely, the EU could still retaliate. Von der Leyen
said she expected the deal to last for the remainder of the Trump presidency.
EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovié said yesterday he hoped the deal would be
a “step to a broader EU-US trade investment agreement in the future</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>US freezes export curbs in push for China accord</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The United States has temporarily frozen restrictions on
technology exports to China to avoid hurting ongoing trade talks with Beijing
and to help President Donald Trump secure a meeting with President Xi Jinping
this year, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security,
which runs export controls, has been asked to hold off on tough moves on China,
according to multiple current and former US officials. US and Chinese officials
met in Stockholm yesterday for a third round of trade talks, following previous
meetings in Geneva and London.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While Trump wants to avoid actions that could disrupt
efforts to meet Xi, some officials argue that the US is hamstrung on export
controls because of the risk that China retaliates by restricting the export of
rare earths and magnets. China had already imposed such curbs in May for the
first time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Earlier this year, Trump’s team prepared to restrict
technology exports to China. In April, they notified Nvidia that it would block
the export of its H20 chip, which was designed for the Chinese market after the
Biden administration had already restricted more advanced chips. However, Trump
reversed course following direct lobbying from Nvidia chief executive Jensen
Huang.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The H20 has become the focus of a power struggle between
security officials, who say the chip will help China’s military, and Nvidia,
which argues that blocking US technology exports will simply push Chinese
groups to accelerate innovation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Twenty national security experts and former
officials—including Matt Pottinger, deputy national security adviser in Trump’s
first administration—were understood to be writing to Commerce Secretary Howard
Lutnick to express concern. The letter, seen by the Financial Times, was also
signed by David Feith, former top National Security Council technology official
in the current Trump administration, and Liza Tobin, who served in the NSC
during Trump’s first term. Kyle Bass, a Trump supporter and founder of Hayman
Capital Management, also signed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The experts argue that the H20 is a “potent accelerator of
China’s frontier AI capabilities,” outpacing the advanced Nvidia H100 chip
(which is blocked for export) in “inference”—the execution of AI functions as
opposed to the training of AI models. They warn that it would help China
develop autonomous weapon systems, intelligence surveillance platforms, and
other military advancements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nvidia said the criticisms in the letter were “misguided”
and “inconsistent” with the AI action plan recently unveiled by Trump.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trump acknowledges ‘real starvation’ afflicting Gaza and
promises more aid</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>FT Reporters</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>US President Donald Trump has said for the first time that
“starvation” is afflicting people in Gaza as he pledged to get more food into
the territory, saying he was working on “various plans” with the Israeli
government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as they
held talks in Scotland yesterday, Trump said the images he had seen of
malnourished children were real, despite claims from Israel’s Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu that there was no starvation in the strip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s real starvation stuff,” Trump said. “I see it, you
can't fake that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Those children look very hungry,” he added, describing what
he'd seen on television. “We have to get the kids fed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The comments will increase pressure on Israel to expedite
deliveries of aid into Gaza, as the UN and other bodies warn of the acute risk
of famine. Gaza’s health ministry has reported more than 80 “famine and
malnutrition-related deaths” in July, including 14 yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Starmer described the situation as “an absolute catastrophe”
and said “people in Britain are revolted... at what they are seeing on their
screens. So we have got to get to that ceasefire.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Taking questions at Turnberry, one of Trump's Scottish golf
courses, the president spoke primarily of short-term plans to get more food aid
delivered but was vague on the details.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Downing Street had earlier said Starmer would present a “UK
plan” for “sustainable peace” in the Middle East to Trump after discussing the
proposal with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel
Macron at the weekend. London said Starmer and Trump had agreed “to work
together to bring an end to the misery and starvation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merz said Israel “must also do its part” to improve the
situation, underlining how the staunch supporter of Israel has adopted a more
critical stance towards Netanyahu’s government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the European plans appeared to have gained minimal
traction with Trump, who was non-committal on what might happen in the next few
days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He said Washington would help “set up food centres where
people can walk in with no boundaries,” in apparent criticism of the US-funded
Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Local officials say more than 1,000 people have
been killed trying to reach aid in recent months, many in attacks by Israeli
troops while trying to reach GHF sites.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=275 src="FT_files/image028.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Frustration with Putin as Trump shortens window for avoiding
sanctions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Steff Chavez — New York, Christopher Miller — Kyiv,
Courtney Weaver — Berlin</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Donald Trump has given Russia a shorter window of 10 to 12
days to agree a ceasefire in Ukraine or face tighter sanctions, as his
frustration with his Russian counterpart escalates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking at his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland yesterday,
the US president said he would bring forward the 50-day deadline he previously
set Vladimir Putin to avoid so-called secondary sanctions. “I’m going to reduce
that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number,” said Trump. “I’m going to
make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s no reason in waiting,” he added in a joint
appearance with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. “I want to be generous, but
we just don't see any progress being made.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump on July 14 threatened Moscow with “severe” tariffs and
secondary sanctions against countries that buy Russian oil, if Putin does not
reach a truce with Ukraine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The US president signalled yesterday he does not believe
Putin will comply within the original 50-day window. “I think I already know
the answer, what is going to happen,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump added that he would confirm the new deadline last
night or today, describing himself as “very disappointed” with the Russian
president. “I’m not so interested in talking [to Putin] any more,” he said. “He
talks. We have such nice conversations... and then people die the following
night in a missile” strike. “Every time I think it’s going to end, he kills
people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While Trump spent the early months of his presidency blaming
the conflict on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his tone has shifted
recently, particularly since the US and Ukrainian presidents met during the
Nato summit just over a month ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Kremlin did not have an immediate response to Trump’s
new ultimatum, but before his comments on the shorter ceasefire deadline,
Russian officials were continuing to insist Moscow was open to talks. “We are
open to dialogue. President Putin has repeatedly spoken about this, with any
other country, including European ones,” foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said
yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, said a Trump-Putin
meeting was possible during the Russian president's visit to China in
September, but so far no specific preparations were under way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yesterday, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Andriy
Yermak, welcomed Trump’s decision to bring forward the ceasefire deadline,
thanking him for “standing firm and delivering a clear message of peace through
strength.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Russia in recent months has increasingly used “swarm”
tactics in its drone attacks against Ukraine, cutting through Kyiv’s air
defences at the highest rate since Putin’s full-scale invasion began in
February 2022.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump's shift in position also comes as Russian forces
intensify their ground offensive across the 1,200km front line in eastern
Ukraine, advancing at the fastest rate in a year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zelenskyy, who spoke with Trump on July 4 and welcomed his
special envoy, Keith Kellogg, to Kyiv the following week, has urged Washington
to step up economic sanctions on Russia to help suppress its war machine.
Washington can cut individuals and countries off from the global economy via
its far-reaching sanctions programme.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The White House has said that if Russia refuses to agree to
a ceasefire, it “will face very steep tariffs,” and Washington would apply
secondary sanctions to countries purchasing oil from Moscow. “That will do deep
damage to Russia’s economy,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said
this month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>UN warns cuts are driving migrants to EU</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The UN’s top refugee official said “catastrophic” budget
cuts to his agency were already driving more migration to Europe, as he urged
EU capitals to fund existing asylum facilities in Africa rather than create new
systems. Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, told the
Financial Times that there was mounting evidence of Sudanese moving north
towards Europe rather than staying in Sudan or neighbouring Chad, where many
had found support previously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The budget cuts that are imposed on us by donors are
catastrophic also from the point of view of how you manage these flows,” Grandi
said, adding that ignoring the developments in African countries was “a big
strategic mistake.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Give more assistance to states where people are ready to
stay before going back home. You solve a lot of your problems by doing that,”
he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The UNHCR's budget has been drastically reduced after US
President Donald Trump cut his country’s funding from $2bn to about $390mn this
year. France, Italy and Germany have also cut support, compounding a crisis.
The UN agency has let go of a third of its staff and put programmes worth
$1.4bn on hold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faced with a backlog of asylum cases and rising
anti-immigration sentiment, many EU countries have sought to externalize parts
of their asylum systems, including by screening applicants in countries outside
the bloc. Such schemes, driven by countries with hardline stances such as
Denmark and Italy, have been controversial, and previous efforts by the UK to
establish asylum facilities in Rwanda failed over human rights concerns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grandi said it would be a “much better investment” to spend
money in countries where there were large refugee populations already that were
ready to stay, such as Chad, Iran or Kenya.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The number of people travelling to Europe via Libya has
recently increased, and EU countries are keen to give the Libyan authorities
more funding to prevent people from crossing the Mediterranean. But efforts to
cooperate with the Libyan authorities and the rival armed groups that control
part of the country have been fraught.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU has sealed several agreements with African countries
to halt immigration and is now working on further “solutions” involving non-EU
countries. Proposals include sending rejected asylum seekers to so-called
“return hubs” or screening asylum seekers who have been rescued in the
Mediterranean in northern African countries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grandi said his agency was willing to participate in such
schemes if proper safeguards were in place, including that European countries
maintained their responsibility for the people in question. This was not the
case with the UK’s Rwanda scheme.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If it is dumping the responsibilities of people that are
seeking asylum in Europe entirely on the country selected, then I think it
would be a bit more problematic,” he said. “If it is helping out with a system
that offers sufficient guarantees and respect of international law, maybe yes.”
But he added: “Let’s be realistic. You have to find a country that is willing
to do it. I’m not very optimistic that you have countries queueing up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grandi urged European governments to “consult” with the UN,
adding: “There are windows of opportunity to do some of these innovative
things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Beijing tries to boost births with $500 child subsidy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China has launched its first nationwide programme of
childcare subsidies as it steps up efforts to boost birth rates and give more
spending power to households with young children. The government will give
families Rmb3,600 ($503) a year for each child under the age of three, state
news agency Xinhua said yesterday. The subsidy will be applied from January
2025 but families with children born between 2022 and 2024 can apply for
partial handouts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The policy is expected to benefit more than 20mn families
each year, Xinhua reported, citing a spokesperson from China’s National Health
Commission. A health commission official said “the direct distribution of cash
subsidies” could “help alleviate the financial burden of raising children” and
“assuage the fertility anxieties of young couples”, Xinhua said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The measure, long discussed by academics and policymakers,
is a response to China’s looming demographic crisis, fuelled by plunging
fertility rates and a decline in marriages. It is also an effort to boost weak
consumer spending in the world’s second largest economy, despite recent robust
quarterly economic growth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The sums involved are too small to have a near-term impact
on the birth rate or consumption,” said Zichun Huang, China economist at
Capital Economics. “But the policy does mark a major milestone in terms of
direct handouts to households and could lay the groundwork for more fiscal
transfers in future.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China has recorded three consecutive years of population
decline despite the end of a decades-long one-child policy that restricted the
size of families until 2016. The number of births rose by about 520,000 last
year to 9.5mn, barely half of the peak of 17.9mn in 2017. There were 10.9mn
deaths in 2024.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The subsidies also follow months of calls for the government
to support household consumption. While China recorded real economic growth of
5.2 per cent in the second quarter, widespread falling prices meant nominal
growth was much weaker at 3.9 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The move echoes initiatives from other countries facing
demographic strains, from income tax breaks for new mothers in Hungary to
childcare subsidies in Poland and cash payments in South Korea and Japan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Samsung to supply Tesla with AI chips in $16.5bn deal</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boost for struggling Korean group • Musk hails strategic
importance</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Christian Davies and Song Jung-a — Seoul</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Samsung Electronics has won a $16.5bn order to produce
Tesla’s next generation of custom artificial intelligence chips, raising hopes
of a turnaround in the South Korean tech giant’s struggling contract chipmaking
business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The eight-year contract, announced by Samsung in a
regulatory filing and confirmed by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk yesterday,
is the biggest deal Samsung’s chip business has won from a single customer. Its
value is equivalent to 7.6 per cent of the company’s 2024 revenue. Samsung
shares rose 6 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Musk wrote on his social media platform X that Samsung would
produce Tesla’s next-generation AI6 chip at its new manufacturing facility in
Texas, part of a $40bn investment made by the South Korean company with
assistance from subsidies under former US president Joe Biden’s Chips and
Science Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The custom chip will be used to power Tesla’s autonomous
driving and humanoid technologies. Musk noted during an earnings call last week
that he hoped the AI6 chip could also be used in data centres to power Tesla’s
AI model training programmes. That would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on
general-purpose graphics processing units produced by companies such as Nvidia
and AMD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Musk said Samsung had &quot;agreed to allow Tesla to assist
in maximising manufacturing efficiency&quot; and that he would &quot;walk the
line personally to accelerate the pace of progress.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The fab is conveniently located not far from my
house,&quot; added Musk, who also said &quot;the strategic importance of this
is hard to overstate.&quot; He later posted that the $16.5bn figure was
&quot;just the bare minimum.&quot; &quot;Actual output is likely to be several
times higher,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The announcement marks a victory for Samsung as it struggles
to gain foundry market share from global leader Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., Tesla’s contract chip partner for the AI5 chip, which is
expected to enter mass production later this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Samsung this year had delayed until 2026 the start of
operations in its 2-nanometre chip plant in Taylor, Texas, as it struggled to
persuade large customers to switch from TSMC, which has also built
manufacturing facilities in the US.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Macquarie analysts warned last September that Samsung’s
$17bn facility could end up as a &quot;big stranded asset&quot; owing to a lack
of big clients, while the South Korean technology group’s contract chipmaking
business is estimated to have suffered a Won4tn ($3bn) operating loss in the
first half of this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Samsung, which will report full second-quarter earnings on
Thursday, this month projected a 56 per cent drop in second-quarter operating
profit compared with the same quarter last year, amid US restrictions on China
and its failure to pass stringent performance tests to supply key customer
Nvidia with advanced memory products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kim Yang-paeng, a researcher at Korea Institute of
Industrial Economics and Trade, said the Tesla deal would help Samsung’s
foundry in Texas to improve its yields — the share of usable chips produced —
and broaden its customer base.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Winning a big order from a global company can prompt
other Big Tech companies to consider Samsung as an alternative to TSMC,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=617 src="FT_files/image029.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Russian state-owned airline Aeroflot was forced to cancel
dozens of flights yesterday, after a hacking group claimed credit for a
devastating year-long cyber attack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The outage suffered by the country’s largest carrier is the
latest in a series of cyber attacks against state-owned Russian enterprises
this year, and one of several claimed by a new hacker group called Silent Crow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By late morning yesterday, 49 flights had been cancelled and
dozens more delayed, according to Aeroflot. The airline, which did not
immediately confirm details of the hack, said it was working to “restore all
services to normal as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is not known whether Silent Crow, which posts messages in
Russian and created a Telegram account only last December, is linked to a
foreign state. The group said yesterday that it had been inside Aeroflot’s IT
system for a year, in an attack orchestrated with Cyber Partisans, a group of
Belarusian hackers that operates outside its home country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Silent Crow said it had been able to “obtain and download”
Aeroflot’s “entire array of flight history databases,” destroy 7,000 servers,
and steal 20 terabytes of data, including surveillance systems files and
recordings of executives’ conversations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Russia's prosecutor-general’s office confirmed the airline
hack and said it had opened a criminal investigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Russia has experienced an increase in cyber attacks since
the beginning of its full-scale war in Ukraine, said Vyacheslav Kirillov, an
expert at cyber security group Kaspersky. Hackers were increasingly targeting
financial organisations, the public sector, telecom providers and the media, he
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first attack claimed by Silent Crow was against
Rosreestr, the government agency managing property and land records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last week, Ukrainian news outlets reported that Ukrainian
hackers were behind a cyber attack on Gazprom that caused significant
disruptions and destroyed vast amounts of data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other Russian businesses hit by cyber attacks this year
include state rail company Russian Railways, the Moscow metro system and
Russian internet provider ASVT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said
reports of the Aeroflot attack were “alarming.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Russia's aviation sector has become increasingly stymied by
Ukrainian drone attacks — one of Kyiv’s few tools for making the three-year war
hit home for middle-class Russians. Russian airlines were forced to cancel 485
flights in early July during a particularly bad period for drone strikes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=428 src="FT_files/image030.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=356 height=469 src="FT_files/image031.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s Shaolin Temple has said that its head has been
placed under investigation for alleged criminal offences including
embezzlement, in the latest controversy to engulf the so-called CEO monk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abbot Shi Yongxin has been suspended from his post and
placed under “joint investigation from multiple departments,” the temple said
in a statement on Sunday. It added that he was suspected of having improper
relationships with multiple women and fathering at least one illegitimate
child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shi Yongxin is suspected of criminal offences, embezzling
project funds and temple assets [and] seriously violating Buddhist precepts,”
the statement said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Given that Shi is suspected of criminal offences, the
statement probably refers to official bodies such as the police or China’s
religious or anti-corruption authorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Buddhist Association of China yesterday revoked Shi’s
clergy certificate, saying in a statement that “his wrongdoings seriously
damaged the reputation of the Buddhist community and the image of monks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shi Yongxin could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saffron-robed Shi is credited with transforming the Shaolin
Temple, the cradle of Zen Buddhism and a home for Chinese martial arts, into a
global brand over the past two decades. But religious adherents have long
criticised Shi for what they saw as excessive commercialisation of one of
China’s most important Buddhist sites.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He disappeared for several months in 2015 after he was
accused of similar charges of improper relationships and embezzlement, but he
was cleared two years later. Sunday’s statement by the temple came after days
of speculation that Shi was under investigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“His wrongdoing seriously damaged the reputation of the
Buddhist community and the image of monks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shi has been a high-profile promoter of the 1,500-year-old
temple, which is located on the holy Song mountain in central Henan province,
since he was appointed abbot in 1999. The temple’s monks are known worldwide
for their elaborate fighting systems. Under Shi’s leadership, they formed a
troupe that performed for paying audiences, sent disciples to hundreds of
Shaolin-associated kung fu academies and meditation centres, and rented out the
temple’s name to countless films.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shi’s keenness on commercial ventures earned him the
nickname “CEO monk” from China’s media.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Throughout his career, Shi has met among others Nelson
Mandela, Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Queen Elizabeth II, and Henry
Kissinger. In February, he met Pope Francis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 2015 investigation followed claims he lived an indulgent
lifestyle, receiving a Volkswagen SUV as a gift and wearing a robe threaded
with gold. He was also criticised over the temple’s role in a planned $380mn
kung fu theme park in Australia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Investigators in Henan province later found he used millions
of renminbi donated by one of his disciples to help develop the temple’s
interests, and that a fleet of 15 cars was registered to the temple. But Shi
had not used temple assets for personal gain, they said. Months earlier,
investigators also dismissed allegations that Shi had fathered two children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 2011, Shi told the Financial Times that the SUV was a
gift from local government as thanks for the tourism revenue generated by the
temple, which welcomes millions of visitors a year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other items, such as iPads, were also gifts, he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>UK has much to learn from India’s UPI digital payments
network</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Patrick Jenkins</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last week, as India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi was
preparing to board his plane to the UK to announce the countries’ new
mangoes-to-motor-cars trade deal, his government put out a little-noticed press
release: India’s UPI digital payments network was now processing real-time
transactions at a rate of 640mn a day, overtaking Visa to become the world
leader.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The network has rocketed in importance in India, thanks to
the country’s vast population of 1.4bn and its enthusiastic embrace of digital
finance. Indian pride in UPI infrastructure — built by the state but leveraged
by fintechs — contrasts starkly with the country’s other well-known
infrastructure shortcomings: jammed, poor-quality roads; perennially half-built
metro lines; painfully slow utility connections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Businesses cite such issues as a micro-frustration and as a
macro-problem, putting a brake on economic expansion, which hovers just above 6
per cent — high in a low-growth world, but not high enough to drive GDP per
capita meaningfully beyond the current $2,900.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The UPI model needs to be replicated in everything the
state does,” says one former Modi adviser now in the private sector. “It’s
about eliminating red tape and paperwork.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>UPI has turned urban India — and large swaths of the
country’s vast rural hinterland — into a more efficient, less cash-centric
economy. Along the way it has boosted financial inclusion: 89 per cent of
Indians now have a financial account of some kind, according to the World Bank,
compared with just 35 per cent in 2011. Benefits and other government
distributions can be made directly into people’s bank accounts with no
“leakage” to corrupt intermediaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has also allowed a growing proportion of Indians to
become active private investors. Sebi, the markets regulator, reckons more than
130mn people now have investment accounts, up nearly fivefold in the past five
years, and expected to hit 400mn in the next five.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite a cooling in India’s stock market performance,
strong growth combined with smartphone investment technology have driven a mass
movement of savings out of bank deposits and property into stocks. Much of that
money has been invested via a mutual fund sector that has motivated investors
with an acclaimed “mutual funds sahi hai” (“mutual funds are good”) marketing
campaign. But there is also an army of individual traders who pick stocks for
quick gains. And at the highest-risk end of the spectrum, many also bet on
options following the advent of derivatives that can be bought and sold in one
day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Volumes have fallen, market participants say, following a
Sebi push to deter such speculation, but as of last year, Indian retail
investors were estimated to account for close to a third of all global equity
options trading with nine in 10 losing money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if over-exuberance has burnt the highest risk-takers,
India’s new band of retail investors is also a clear positive for the economy,
sustaining a vibrant ecosystem of stock market expansion and initial public
offerings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>V Anantha Nageswaran, Modi’s chief economic adviser, said:
“Private investors have definitely contributed to the health of the IPO
market.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Private investor Sips, or systematic investment plans, are
now putting billions of dollars into IPOs every month, according to lawyers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Goldman Sachs has pointed out, India’s stock markets
raised a record $70bn of equity finance last year (including $19bn in IPOs) —
second only to the US.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trade deal Modi struck last week when he met UK Prime
Minister Sir Keir Starmer was relatively thin — covering some agricultural
exports, some automotive imports and a few other areas of economic mutual
interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The idea of collaborating on financial infrastructure might
be fraught — UPI itself relies on a system of universal digital identity, the
like of which previous UK governments have backed away from in the face of
opposition from privacy campaigners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sceptics may also point out that a developed market such as
the UK already has a wealth of digital finance offerings, even if they are
fragmented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But if Starmer and chancellor Rachel Reeves are serious
about their stated mission of driving economic expansion through financial
services reform and greater private investment, then taking a cue from
something such as UPI with all its attendant economic participation and growth
benefits would be rather more transformative than importing a few more mangoes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Thailand and Cambodia agree pact to end fighting</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand and Cambodia agreed a ceasefire to end fighting
along their shared border that has killed more than 30 people and displaced
about 300,000 in recent days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pact, due to come into effect last night, was sealed by
leaders of the two neighbouring south-east Asian nations at talks in Malaysia
held as their governments traded accusations of firing into each other's
territory for a fifth day. US President Donald Trump had warned he would
terminate trade talks with both nations if they did not stop fighting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia’s prime minister and rotating chair
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, unveiled the pact in Kuala
Lumpur, flanked by the Cambodian and Thai leaders. “Prime Minister Hun Manet
and acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai have expressed their positions
and willingness for immediate ceasefire, and [a] return to normalcy,” Anwar
told a news briefing. The Malaysian prime minister added Trump had “been in
contact” with both countries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He said Thailand and Cambodia had agreed to a meeting of
their regional military leaders today, to be followed by a meeting of defence
attaches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They would also convene a gathering of the General Border
Committee, a bilateral military group, on August 4.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed credit
for the ceasefire and said he had called the Thai and Cambodian leaders. “I
have instructed my Trade Team to restart negotiations on Trade,” Trump wrote.
“I have now ended many Wars in just six months — I am proud to be the President
of PEACE!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Malaysian leader said China, which has friendly
relations with both Cambodia and Thailand, had kept in “close contact” with
them and Malaysia during efforts to broker a ceasefire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s foreign ministry said yesterday it was “deeply
saddened” by the casualties caused and that it intended to “play a constructive
role in promoting a ceasefire and ending the conflict”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hun Manet said he hoped to stop immediately the fighting,
which had “cost many lives” and created 140,000 refugees in Cambodia and
160,000 in Thailand. Phumtham thanked Anwar, Trump and China for helping to
broker an outcome that reflected “Thailand’s desire for a peaceful resolution”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fighting broke out last week amid rising tensions between
Thailand, a US treaty ally, and Cambodia over a long running and emotive border
dispute. The two sides accused each other of targeting civilian areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Earlier yesterday, they continued to exchange fire. Cambodia
claimed Thailand had fired first after 3am on Monday. Thailand said it had been
attacked, and fired back to defend itself and prevent an “incursion into
strategic terrain”. It dismissed Cambodia’s claim its forces had used chemical
weapons as “groundless”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Cambodia had very little option but to secure a ceasefire,”
said Virak Ou, founder of Future Forum, a Phnom Penh-based think-tank. “The US
is the biggest market for Cambodian exports, so any trade deal with the US will
have broad implications for the economy for years to come.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>EU says Temu breaks digital rules over sale of illegal
goods</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Laura Dubois — Brussels</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brussels has accused Chinese ecommerce group Temu of
breaching the bloc’s landmark digital rules by failing to do enough to prevent
the sale of illegal products on its platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In preliminary findings published yesterday, the European
Commission said its probe had revealed “a high risk” of EU consumers
encountering illegal products on Temu's site. It also said the results of a
mystery shopping exercise had found products that breached EU rules on the
marketplace, including baby toys and small electronics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brussels launched its investigation into Temu last year
under the bloc’s Digital Services Act, asking the online retailer for
information about its actions to restrict sales of illegal items “as well as
risks relating to consumer protection, public health and users’ wellbeing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU legislation puts online platforms under greater
pressure to police their sites more aggressively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The commission found that a risk assessment submitted by
Temu relating to the sale of illegal products on its site was “inaccurate”, and
relied on general industry information rather than specific details about its
marketplace. The commission said that might have led to “inadequate mitigation
measures” against the spread of illegal products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Temu is a priority for us. The problems caused on the
European market by non-compliant products coming from online marketplaces are
an issue,” said a commission official.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The findings come as the bloc seeks to make ecommerce
platforms liable for dangerous or illegal products sold online. The commission
in June accused rival Chinese online marketplace AliExpress of not doing enough
to prevent the dissemination of counterfeit goods or unsafe products. It
launched an investigation into Shein, on consumer protection concerns, earlier
this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU also plans to levy a flat fee of €2 on billions of
small packages entering the bloc, mainly from China, in a fresh blow to Temu
and Shein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Temu has several weeks to respond to the inquiry’s findings,
and could face a fine of up to 6 per cent of its global annual revenue if it is
found in breach of rules. Brussels is also looking at Temu’s alleged use of
“addictive design features,” how products are recommended on the site, and
access to data, as part of the wider probe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Houthis vow to step up attacks on vessels using Red Sea</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yemen’s Houthi militants have vowed to “escalate” their
attacks on merchant ships, raising the risk for ships on the vital trade route
through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Iran-backed group said in a statement it would attack
ships belonging to any company trading with Israel “regardless of the
nationality of that company”. The group, which started its attacks in November
2023 and claims to be acting in support of Gaza’s Palestinians, said it was
reacting to “rapid developments” in the enclave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Houthis in early July sank two ships — the Magic Seas
and the Eternity C — in their first Red Sea attacks on merchant shipping since
December.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Houthi attacks have sharply reduced the numbers of vessels
using the Red Sea and Suez Canal to sail between Asia and Europe, with many
shipowners diverting via the longer route round the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At least 11 members of the Eternity C’s crew are still being
held by the Houthis in Yemen, according to one person familiar with the
situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Martin Kelly, head of advisory for EOS Risk Group, said
Sunday’s statement signalled a “shift in intent” from the Houthis. “I think we
could see some attacks in the near term,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another maritime security expert, speaking on condition of
anonymity, pointed out there was widespread international disquiet at the
worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “I would have thought, given what is
going on in Gaza and the international outrage about it, that would give them
cover [for renewed attacks].”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kelly suggested the statement’s reference to attacking ships
linked to any country might indicate a renewed willingness to attack US-linked
vessels. The Houthis have been observing an apparent ceasefire with the US in
which they avoided attacking American-linked ships while the US held off
attacking Houthi assets in Yemen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other maritime expert pointed out that the Houthis’
announced targeting criteria were often very loosely applied. When it said it
was attacking ships linked to Israel, the UK and the US, it attacked many
vessels with only tenuous links to those countries, sometimes on the basis of
outdated information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In the past, they've... attacked a ship and found a link
afterwards,” the expert said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As well as the crew members being held by the Houthis, 10
seafarers from the Eternity C were rescued by a private security contractor
after the attack, according to the person familiar with the situation. Two are
confirmed dead, while another two are presumed dead. Only two previous attacks
by the group had been fatal, with a total of four seafarers killed in previous
incidents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The person said there were no current negotiations under way
between Cosmosphips Management, the Eternity C’s manager, and the Houthis for
the seafarers release.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Hutchison in Cosco talks on ports deal</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Chan Ho-him and Arjun Neil Alim — Hong Kong, Ryan
McMorrow — Shanghai</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison has said that it
plans to bring on a “major” Chinese investor for a consortium backed by US
asset manager BlackRock, as the company seeks Beijing’s approval for a $23bn
ports sale that includes key assets in the Panama Canal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While CK Hutchison did not name the investor, four people
close to the discussions said China’s state-owned shipping conglomerate Cosco
was in talks to join the group that includes Swiss-Italian shipping company
MSC.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under one of the options being discussed, Cosco would
receive a stake in 41 global ports but not the two Panama Canal ports that US
President Donald Trump has alleged are subject to Chinese influence, said three
of the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CK Hutchison shares yesterday closed almost 1 per cent off
after the announcement, after climbing 9 per cent in the past week on hopes for
the deal. Cosco Shipping Holdings’ Hong Kong shares fell nearly 3 per cent. The
companies did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by billionaire Li
Ka-shing in March announced plans to sell its portfolio of 43 non-Chinese
ports, including two in the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by Terminal
Investment Limited, majority owned by MSC, and BlackRock’s unit Global
Infrastructure Partners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The group remains in discussions with members of the
consortium with a view to inviting major strategic investor from the PRC to
join as a significant member of the consortium,&quot; CK Hutchison said in a
filing to Hong Kong’s stock exchange yesterday, cautioning that “there can be
no certainty that the discussions for the New Arrangements will reach a
successful conclusion.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An exclusive negotiation window between CK Hutchison and the
consortium expired on Sunday after Beijing expressed frustration over the deal,
arguing that it would hand controlling power of strategic global ports to
western investors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under initial deal arrangements, BlackRock would take a
controlling stake in the two Panama ports, and MSC would hold majority
ownership of the rest of CK Hutchison’s 41 global ports including those in
Europe, south-east Asia and the Middle East.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China has been pushing for Cosco to be involved in the deal
and the consortium is likely to accept, according to a person close to the
deal, as it could help with getting it past the country’s antitrust regulator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s foreign ministry yesterday said that Beijing was
aware of the announcement and that it would regulate the deal in accordance
with the law to “safeguard national sovereignty and security” and maintain
“market fairness and justice.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Fintechs raise the alarm over plan by JPMorgan to charge
for its data</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Start-ups say bank's move to end free access to customer
information is a thinly disguised ploy to kill competition<br>
AKILA QUINIO AND JOSHUA FRANKLIN<br>
NEW YORK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=342 src="FT_files/image032.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JPMorgan Chase has alarmed financial technology start-ups
with plans to charge them to access its customer data, a move that could
endanger their business models and is seen by some as chief executive Jamie
Dimon's attempt to crush nascent competitors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of June, the largest US bank by assets sent out
price sheets to start-ups that have long relied on free access to bank consumer
data to power other financial services. This includes data aggregators, such as
Plaid, that have grown in the past decade thanks to this free data-sharing
model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dispute highlights the interconnected nature of banks
and non-bank companies in providing financial services in a digital world, and
the cost of sharing the data between the two sides. But the proposed charges by
JPMorgan have triggered outrage from smaller fintech players.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many of them argue that their business models would not be
able to withstand the steep fees and that those that will would be forced to
pass down significant costs to consumers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steve Boms, executive director of the Financial Data and
Technology Association, a trade group representing about 30 aggregators and
fintech companies, said that JPMorgan's action was a &quot;pure and
simple&quot; attempt to kill competition that would &quot;put third parties out
of business altogether&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Across all the companies that received the notices,
the cost of just accessing Chase data is somewhere from 60 percent and in some
cases well over 100 percent of their annual revenue for the year,&quot; said
Boms, whose group's members include Plaid, Fiserv and Intuit. &quot;Just from
one bank.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chase's fees could take effect as early as the start of
September, though the bank is in talks with the various companies that could
alter the timeline and the amounts charged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We have explicitly reserved the right to charge a fee
for data access since day one of our agreements,&quot; a JPMorgan spokesperson
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under rules finalised by the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau during former US president Joe Biden's administration, banks would be
prohibited from charging third parties for access to consumer data. However,
the gutting of the regulator by the Trump administration has led to this rule
being changed, opening the door for banks to set their own fees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JPMorgan's argument is that banks have spent millions of
dollars to build APIs, or application programming interfaces, that allow
fintechs safely to access customer data. The bank says that of the 2bn monthly
API requests it receives from aggregators, about 90 per cent are unrelated to a
customer using a fintech service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Having a charging structure will ensure that data is
provided only when customers request it, and that data middlemen are fostering
a safe, secure data ecosystem that we built and maintain—and that their entire
industry was built on,&quot; a bank spokesperson said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inside the bank, there is a view that these costs and
requests will only significantly increase in the years ahead. The Bank Policy
Institute, an industry lobby group, argued earlier this month that &quot;data
sharing comes at a cost&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Charging data middlemen responsible for the largest
volume of requests allows banks to cover basic business expenses without
passing those costs on to consumers,&quot; the BPI said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JPMorgan's Dimon has also consistently warned of the threat
of fintechs to banks. In April, the CEO wrote in his annual letter that his
bank needed &quot;to be as nimble as they are and use our skills and
capabilities to stay ahead&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other banks could follow JPMorgan's lead—Pennsylvania-based
PNC, the ninth-largest US lender by assets, has said it is discussing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I applaud what JP did. I think they're exactly
right,&quot; PNC chief executive Bill Demchak told analysts earlier this month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Financial Technology Association, which represents the
fintechs, has taken its case to the courts calling on them to uphold the CFPB's
revoked rule, which it said &quot;reflects a bipartisan commitment to
modernising how Americans manage their financial lives&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We've seen the nation's biggest banks really take
advantage of this moment of regulatory uncertainty to consolidate their
position in the market and to crush competition,&quot; said Miranda Margowsky,
an FTA spokesperson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Critics of the fee-charging model also note that the move
would make the US an outlier in explicitly allowing banks to charge for open
banking access.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>'We've seen the nation's biggest banks really take advantage
of this moment of regulatory uncertainty'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The data-sharing technology has flourished in jurisdictions
where it is mandated to be largely free, including the UK, Brazil and Sweden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It would put us completely the opposite of every other
country with open banking,&quot; said Boms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fintechs are also seeking to gain political traction by
highlighting the risk that the move could adversely affect the crypto
industry—an area championed by the Trump administration—because crypto
companies also rely on open banking access to move money between bank accounts
and crypto wallets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a letter to US President Donald Trump, trade groups that
included the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council for Innovation urged
him to intervene and reverse the regulator's decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump's son Donald Trump Jr and David Sacks, an influential
crypto adviser to the White House, have publicly sided with the fintechs
against JPMorgan on social media platform X.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Employers fight auditing ‘hell’ from ICE agency</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Taylor Nicole Rogers — New York</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=383 src="FT_files/image033.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A growing number of US businesses complain they are dealing
with a deluge of paperwork as the Trump administration expands audits of their
employment authorisations in its push to deport undocumented migrants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the media are focused on images of masked Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents storming farms, factories and construction
sites to arrest foreign nationals, executives are more worried about ICE's
growing scrutiny of the forms they file to demonstrate that their staff are
authorised to work in the US, called “I-9”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More than a dozen human resources leaders, global mobility
professionals and their immigration attorneys told the Financial Times that
they are stuck in “I-9 hell” as they race to identify and fix errors on the
forms before receiving a dreaded Notice of Inspection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Employers under audit are given three days to hand over I-9
forms and supporting documents for all current employees. Errors as small as
forgetting to tick a box can result in fines that start at $2,861 per violation
and often stretch into the millions, plus criminal charges for executives. In
April, ICE said it fined three Denver businesses more than $8mn for employing
unauthorised workers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last month, the general manager of a San Diego
powder-coating business was sentenced to one year of probation after pleading
guilty to hiring undocumented immigrants without authorisation to work, the
justice department said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I said it couldn't get worse,” said John Mazzeo, associate
general counsel at job applicant screening provider Vertical Screen. “It
happened to get worse.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The panic among employers has reached a fever pitch since
May, when ICE said that its agents visited several Washington DC restaurants to
initiate audits in person. The notices are traditionally sent via mail or
email.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Trump administration is “working with American employers
to ensure they have the legal workforce they need to be successful,” White
House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said, adding that recent worksite raids had
“rescued migrant children” from a marijuana facility and resulted in the arrest
of a paedophile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People familiar with the agency’s thinking said that while
deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records remained the priority,
auditing employers had emerged as a cost-effective way for agents to identify
potential targets for removal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ICE does not regularly publish data on the number of audits
it is conducting, leaving employers to rely on their personal networks for
information on the crackdown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shaun Staller, a business immigration partner at law firm
Obermayer, said that he had “certainly” seen a substantial increase in audits
since Donald Trump took office in January.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Audits also surged during Trump’s previous term, jumping 374
per cent between the end of the Obama administration in 2017 and 2019.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There was talk in Trump one but nothing like this,” said
Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute who studies
worksite enforcement. “This is completely different in scale.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lawyers said that ICE initially seemed to be targeting
small, service sector businesses in big cities, but that its net was expanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The growing worry in the human resources industry is what
prompted one Atlanta-based executive to initiate an audit of her technology
start-up’s I-9 records for its 700 employees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Our audit revealed many people with expired [Employment
Authorisation Documents], so we had to let them go,” said the executive, who
requested their name be withheld because they feared retribution from their
employer. “It’s I-9 hell.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Employers complain that simply preparing for an ICE
inspection is costly, as it typically involves hiring outside counsel and can
result in needing to replace workers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Vertical Screen has had its “best year ever” as employers
jostle for help with getting their paperwork in order, Mazzeo said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since 1986, US employers have been responsible for verifying
that anyone they hire is legally allowed to work in the country. But the
complexity of the form itself means that “it’s very common for employers not to
have [complete] records,” Staller said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The four-page I-9 form is so technical that US Citizenship
and Immigration Services publishes an eight-page manual on how to complete it.
Employees can present more than 50 combinations of documents to prove their
identity and employment authorisation, according to an analysis by the American
Immigration Lawyers Association.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HR executives also complain that the Trump administration
added a new layer of complexity to the process with its efforts to roll back
Biden-era programmes that extended legal status to migrants from unstable
countries, meaning that documents submitted by hundreds of thousands of workers
from Haiti are suddenly invalid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I would be shocked to hear of any company of size, you know
1,000 people, where they do not at least have to have a conversation with
someone about a fake document,” said Mazzeo, who is also a former ICE attorney.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s just so prevalent, especially with the scrutiny [ICE]
is now giving it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Singapore Airlines suffered a 59 per cent drop in profits
last quarter as it was hit by losses from its stake in Air India, the carrier
embroiled in India's worst aviation disaster in three decades.<br>
Net profits at Singapore's national carrier fell from S$266mn ($207mn) to
S$186mn compared with the same period last year, the group reported yesterday.
It said its losses from associated companies, &quot;notably from Air India's
financial results&quot;, were S$122mn for the three months to the end of June.<br>
Singapore Airlines' revenue rose 1.5 per cent to S$4.8bn in the quarter, which
the group said showed demand for flights remained strong despite economic and
geopolitical uncertainties.<br>
More than 240 passengers and crew died when an Air India flight bound for
London crashed shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad last month, leaving a
sole survivor.<br>
Global focus has shifted to the roles of the Air India pilots after media
reports that the captain may have turned off the plane's fuel switches shortly
after take-off. However, earlier this month, India's Air Accident Investigation
Bureau warned foreign media against &quot;irresponsible&quot; speculation about
the causes of the disaster as the probe continued.<br>
Singapore Airlines acquired a 25 per cent stake in Air India last year after
its joint venture with Tata Sons was absorbed in a merger. Tata had bought Air
India out of state ownership in 2022.<br>
This month, Tata reported that privately held Air India registered an annual
loss of Rs108.59bn ($1.25bn) in the year to the end of March 2025, the first
time it had published financial details since the full merger with its sister
airlines.<br>

power</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Jamie Smyth — New York, Song Jung-a — Seoul</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Canada’s AtkinsRéalis Group plans to deploy its nuclear
reactor technology in the US to compete against Westinghouse, as a growing
number of foreign companies rush to capitalise on Donald Trump’s strategy of
unleashing American atomic energy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Montreal-based group has enlisted support from the
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission for its proposed American expansion and is
scheduling meetings with US officials as it prepares to apply for a reactor
licence from the country’s Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It has also begun
talks with US utilities, which would be the ultimate buyers of its reactors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“AtkinsRéalis Nuclear has begun to explore opportunities for
alternative large nuclear reactor technologies, notably Candu reactors, in the
US,” Joe St-Julian, global president of nuclear at AtkinsRéalis, told the
Financial Times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Candu is a type of pressurised heavy-water nuclear reactor,
which does not need enriched uranium so is perceived as cheaper to operate than
most other commercial reactors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>AtkinsRéalis’s push into the US nuclear reactor market
follows publication of four executive orders by the Trump administration in
May, which set targets to quadruple nuclear energy capacity in the country by
2050, start work on 10 large reactors by 2030, and accelerate regulatory
approvals. Billions of dollars of government incentives are expected to be
provided by the administration, which argues new large-scale nuclear plants are
needed to power the artificial intelligence revolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Westinghouse, the only US-based company with a large reactor
design approved by the NRC and active in the US industry, has told US officials
it can deploy 10 of its AP1000 reactor designs to meet the administration’s
goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But rivals say working on 10 large plants simultaneously
would be a complex and difficult task for a single company, particularly given
that costs are expected to top $75bn, based on government estimates, according
to TD Cowen, an investment bank.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St-Julian said there was huge potential in the US market.
Westinghouse would have “home field advantage” when bidding for contracts but
AtkinsRéalis’s Candu reactor could be a strong competitor, he said. “There used
to be four reactor companies in the US — Westinghouse, General Electric,
Babcock &amp; Wilcox and Utility Engineers — and now there is just one. Could
Westinghouse build 10 AP1000s simultaneously? I don't think so. So I think that
there is an opportunity for Candu in the US.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adam Stein, a nuclear expert at the Breakthrough Institute,
a Washington think-tank, said booming electricity demand and more flexible
licensing regulations could provide opportunities to new entrants in the US,
such as the Candu reactor. “Candu reactors are typically rather expensive but
they have an existing supply chain in Canada because of a recent refurbishment
programme. This could make a big difference.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Supermarket buying power hurts Heineken</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Madeleine Speed</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heineken’s chief executive has blamed the rising power of
European supermarket buying alliances for fraught price negotiations that sent
its beer sales down in the first half of the year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Dutch brewer yesterday reported a 4.7 per cent fall in
sales volumes of European beer in its first half after retailers pulled the
brand from shelves when it stuck to planned price rises despite weak consumer
demand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heineken said the negotiations — primarily in France, the
Netherlands, Germany and Spain — with groups of retailers that band together to
drive down prices had dragged on longer than expected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heineken’s share price was down nearly 8.5 per cent
yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We see a hardening in these negotiations, which is a point
of concern,” said Dolf van den Brink, Heineken chief executive. “But we felt
that we are fighting for the long-term financial viability of our sector.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The brewer's results come at a time of rising tension
between branded goods suppliers and supermarkets, which are less willing to
raise prices for fear of losing customers after a period of soaring costs for
everyday goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Van den Brink said that negotiations were becoming tougher
because retailers were more concerned about affordability and because of the
growing strength of buying groups in Europe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“These buying groups become more powerful, more dominant,
because you're no longer negotiating with an individual retailer in one
country,” he said. “They're really coming together, and you can be delisted in
one country because of a conflict triggered in another country.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Van den Brink said this was “a point of concern” and that
Heineken had asked the Dutch government to “keep an eye on” it. The results
also follow the EU’s trade deal with the US, announced on Sunday, which will
result in tariffs of 15 per cent on most imports from the bloc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Van den Brink said Heineken was not currently shifting its
manufacturing to the US to offset that impact, with 95 per cent of its products
produced in local breweries for local consumers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The only meaningful exception is the US market, and
therefore we are now suffering the impact of these tariffs,” van den Brink
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But... this is something that we anticipated and that we
can mitigate for.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The brewer's net revenues rose 2.1 per cent to €14.2bn in
the first half of the year, beating expectations, while overall sales volumes
fell 1.2 per cent, lower than expected. Organic operating profit increased 7.4
per cent in the same period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The company reaffirmed its operating profit guidance of
between 4 and 8 per cent for the full year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>SoftBank alumnus makes AI university move</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Antoine Gara — New York</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=384 height=160 src="FT_files/image034.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Billionaire former SoftBank executive Marcelo Claure has led
the purchase of a 50 per cent stake in one of the UK’s largest for-profit
universities as he seeks to create a global AI-focused education group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brightstar Capital Partners, the US buyout group Claure
joined this year, has agreed to buy the stake in Arden University for more than
$1bn, according to people briefed on the deal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arden, which says that it has 40,000 undergraduate and
graduate students in the UK, will begin offering UK-accredited degrees to
full-time students globally next year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Claure said he planned to use AI to translate Arden’s
curriculum for some 140 degrees into different languages, with the aim of
quickly expanding in the Middle East, Latin America and other parts of Europe,
including Spain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“AI technology allows you to basically teach a class in
English and be able to deliver to many different students in over 150 different
languages,” said Claure. He also expected to use AI to offer students
individualised tutoring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Claure said Arden would also seek to expand its enrolments
by offering UK student visa sponsorship to foreign students for its in-person
and remote-learning campuses in the UK. “We're going to be recruiting students
from all over the world that want to come to the UK to have an education,” said
Claure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arden generally focuses on professional degrees and its
curriculum offers a mixture of remote and on-campus learning for up to a fifth
of its classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brightstar is buying its 50 per cent stake from current
owner Global University Systems, a Dutch for-profit education conglomerate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The private equity firm was founded by Andrew Weinberg,
Claure’s top aide at the Latin American telecoms group he sold to SoftBank in
2014. Brightstar was also the name of this telecoms group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Claure, who later moved to SoftBank, subsequently led the
group’s efforts to merge Sprint with T-Mobile, and its international investment
operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He left SoftBank in 2022 amid difficult talks over a pay
deal. Lately he has focused on his family office, Claure Group. Claure will
become chair of Arden University and plans to announce AI-focused private
equity deals after joining Brightstar as a partner in April.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brightstar manages more than $5bn in assets and has sold
billions of dollars in assets for large gains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Digital asset lenders dial up risk with ‘microfinance on
steroids’</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>George Steer — New York</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=353 src="FT_files/image035.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A new generation of high-octane crypto ventures are
expanding risk-taking with new forms of digital asset loans, three years after
a market crash triggered a wave of insolvencies for lenders across the
industry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A San Francisco-based lender called Divine Research said it
had extended roughly 30,000 unbacked short-term loans since December, working
with OpenAI chief Sam Altman’s iris-scanning crypto group World to identify
borrowers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crypto lending — a highly risky part of the digital assets
market — blew up in 2022 after a fall in crypto asset prices triggered a spiral
of defaults and bankruptcies, culminating in the collapse of the FTX exchange.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The so-called crypto winter that followed lasted for almost
two years. But President Donald Trump’s unabashed embrace of digital assets has
sent investors flooding back into the market. The price of bitcoin has raced to
record highs and major financial institutions like JPMorgan are considering
dipping their toes into crypto lending.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We're loaning to average folks like high-school teachers,
fruit vendors... basically anyone with access to the internet can get access to
our funds,” Divine’s founder Diego Estevez told the Financial Times. “This is
microfinance on steroids.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Divine offers loans of less than $1,000 worth of Circle’s
stablecoin USDC — a crypto asset that matches the value of the US dollar — to
cash-strapped consumers, mostly overseas. It describes its borrowers as
underserved by “traditional institutions.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It uses Altman’s iris-scanning system to make sure borrowers
who default on their loans cannot create a new account. The loans mostly come
with fixed interest rates of between 20 and 30 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among Divine’s peers is crypto group 3Jane, which in June
received $5.2mn in seed funding from venture group Paradigm — which previously
invested in FTX.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The start-up is already extending uncollateralised USDC
credit lines on the Ethereum blockchain. 3Jane says borrowers have to show
“verifiable proofs” of crypto, bank assets or future cash flows to back the
loan but do not have to hand over any collateral.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unsecured lending is inherently risky because there are no
assets available to recoup losses if a borrower defaults. But it represents a
huge opportunity for the crypto industry, insiders say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Defaulted loans on the 3Jane protocol are sold to US
collections agencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3Jane is also developing a new lending platform that would
involve AI agents, programmes that can execute tasks based on user
instructions. These agents would be “programmatically obliged to follow debt
covenants” and could therefore be lent to “at much lower rates,” 3Jane says.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>US-listed crypto exchange Coinbase in March said it had
teamed up with Altman’s OpenAI to create AI agents with their own crypto
wallets and “equipped with commercial and monetary capabilities.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another protocol called Wildcat is built for market makers
and crypto trading firms seeking to establish “highly customisable, fixed-rate,
undercollateralised credit facilities” using Ethereum, the second-largest
crypto ecosystem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roughly $170mn has so far been lent on its platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like peers Clearpool and TrueFi, Wildcat allows approved
borrowers to create markets where they specify their own terms, such as
interest rates, maturity, and maximum loan capacity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Default rates for the first loan taken out average about 40
per cent, Estevez said. High interest rates “compensate for these losses,” and
free tokens issued to anyone who scans their eye using World can be “partially”
reclaimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of Divine’s borrowers are not regular users of crypto
before signing up. The scheme was piloted in Argentina, which has suffered
years of steep inflation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Loans are funded by deposits from individuals, who Estevez
said are typically people seeking “good yields.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He added: “Anyone can provide liquidity. We’ve engineered
the system such that, after accounting for default rates and the interest rates
on offer, providers will always make a profit.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crypto lending funded by individuals was at the centre of
the 2022 crash when lenders like Celsius and Genesis were unable to pay back
their depositors and filed for bankruptcy. Celsius chief executive Alex
Mashinsky was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud and market
manipulation. Genesis agreed to a $2bn settlement to resolve a lawsuit brought
by New York’s attorney-general, alleging that it defrauded more than 230,000
investors. Genesis did not acknowledge wrongdoing in the case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unsecured loans make up a small fraction of the
multibillion-dollar crypto lending market where groups including Coinbase,
Tether and Galaxy dominate. Major Wall Street banks have also begun extending
collateralised loans to some crypto holders. Cantor Fitzgerald this month
announced a $2bn “Bitcoin Financing Business” initiative to provide leverage to
investors who hold the world’s most valuable digital asset.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>ECB warns over threat to monetary policy from Stablecoins</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Olaf Storbeck — Frankfurt</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rise of stablecoins linked to the US dollar threatens to
undermine the European Central Bank’s control over monetary policy, a senior
official from the central bank has warned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jurgen Schaaf, an adviser in the ECB’s market infrastructure
and payments unit, warned that the rapid adoption of stablecoins could leave
the Eurozone facing similar conditions to “dollarised” emerging economies,
where widespread use of the US currency can hamper local policymakers' efforts
to set interest rates or control the money supply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Global circulation of stablecoins — tokens that track the
value of fiat currencies and are a cornerstone of crypto trading — has risen to
about $250bn. The vast majority are linked to the dollar as President Donald
Trump pushes to establish them as a pillar of mainstream finance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Should US dollar stablecoins become widely used in the euro
area — whether for payments, savings or settlement — the ECB’s control over
monetary conditions could be weakened,” wrote Schaaf in an article published on
the ECB’s blog yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He added that a “disorderly collapse” of private sector
stablecoins could “reverberate across the financial system” with central banks
being increasingly concerned about contagion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tether and Circle operate the two largest stablecoins but
the passage this month of landmark US legislation to regulate the sector is
expected to pave the way for Wall Street banks to launch their own offerings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stablecoins are backed one-for-one by safe assets such as
government bonds and are designed to act as a bridge between cryptocurrencies
and the mainstream financial system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their backers argue that they are more efficient than
international bank transfers but their anonymity has made them popular conduits
for drug trafficking and money laundering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ECB’s warning marks the latest concern among central
bankers over the growth of stablecoins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Bank for International Settlements said last month that
stablecoins “perform badly” as money because they are not backed by central
banks, lack sufficient guardrails against illicit usage and do not have the
flexibility of funding needed to generate loans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump’s drive to promote stablecoins would underpin the
greenback’s global dominance and could lower US borrowing costs, according to
Schaaf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“For Europe, this would mean higher financing costs relative
to the United States, reduced monetary policy autonomy and geopolitical
dependency,” he wrote.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>US banks strike deals to lend into hedge fund boom</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Eric Platt and Amelia Pollard — New York, Ortenca Aliaj —
London</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=373 height=346 src="FT_files/image036.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wall Street banks are expanding their use of complex risk
transfer deals to offload exposure from prime brokerage divisions, freeing up
cash to lend to hedge funds in pursuit of a bigger share of a booming market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Morgan Stanley last year struck a deal with Blackstone to
transfer a portion of the risk on loans made by the bank’s prime brokerage unit
and release capital for more lending, people familiar with the transaction
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The deal, which required Morgan Stanley to retain a portion
of the risk, provided the US investment bank regulatory capital relief and gave
the unit responsible for lending to hedge funds added firepower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>US banks have increasingly turned to credit risk transfers —
also known as synthetic risk transfers — to reduce the amount of capital they
must use to guard against losses on the loans they have underwritten since
domestic regulators blessed the deals in 2023.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the use of SRTs for margin loans marks a jump from the
relatively vanilla corporate and consumer loans that have traditionally
underpinned the capital relief trades.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Banks have been searching for ways to gain that same relief
for their prime brokerage units, which have been a big profit centre as trading
activity has surged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The way to think about SRTs is not strictly about
protecting the downside,” said Michael Shemi, the head of North America
structured credit at Guy Carpenter. “It’s the other way around: they are
designed to unlock the upside for banks. Banks pursue these transactions to
improve profitability and to facilitate growth in specific asset classes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other than Morgan Stanley’s deal with Blackstone, however,
US banks have mostly struggled to complete SRTs on margin loans, according to
more than half a dozen people who transact in the credit risk transfer market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Margin loans allow hedge funds to supercharge their trading,
using the financing from banks’ prime brokerage units to buy stocks and bonds
or enter into swaps and derivatives transactions on borrowed money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Banks are exposed if a big hedge fund fails to meet a margin
call and suffers large losses, inflicting losses on their prime brokerage
units.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Prime brokerage can be a particularly risky business and has
attracted political scrutiny since Archegos Capital Management’s implosion in
2021. Banks including Credit Suisse, Nomura and Morgan Stanley suffered more
than $10bn of combined losses tied to Archegos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Banks have found it hard to complete SRTs on prime broking
loans in part because they often agree to strict confidentiality terms with
their clients and cannot reveal the underlying positions of the hedge funds.
Even describing them could reveal trade secrets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Positions can also change rapidly — given a hedge fund’s
typical trading patterns — meaning the collateral underlying the credit risk
transfer when it is first struck may change days or weeks later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead, an investor must rely on their own view of a bank’s
prime brokerage business and its risk management policies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Banks that have struck these prime brokerage risk transfer
trades have offered so-called white lists to would-be investors and often
described which hedge funds make up the bulk of their exposure. The list
includes the names of hedge funds that could be included in the risk transfer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For some money managers, that can be enough — especially if
they are separately invested with the hedge funds included on those white
lists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In those cases, the money manager can then assess the risks
of the hedge fund’s trading book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even so, people familiar with the discussions said some
banks had found the transactions too expensive to complete</p>

in total pay last year, making him the highest paid chief executive of a
London-listed business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eamonn O’Hare of Zegona received £129mn from a management
share incentive scheme in the year ending December 2024, according to the

totalling slightly less than £1.5mn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The company’s chief operating officer, Robert Samuelson, was
paid a total of £66mn in 2024. The figures were first reported by the Sunday
Times newspaper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zegona, which was founded by O’Hare and Samuelson — both
former Virgin Media executives — in 2015, specialises in buying, turning around
and selling struggling telecoms groups. The most high-profile of its deals was
its €5bn acquisition of Vodafone's Spanish business last year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since a 2023 capital raise to help finance the deal,
Zegona’s share price has risen from about £1.50 in November that year to more
than £8.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In its annual report, Zegona said it had returned Vodafone
Spain to growth and cut costs, including a 28 per cent reduction in headcount.
The report noted the “exceptional contribution” of management over a three-year
period from October 2021 to October 2024.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zegona did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The pay for the Zegona executives is much higher than the UK standard, which
has long lagged behind the US.</p>

$300mn bondholders deal</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EUAN HEALY AND ROBERT SMITH<br>
LONDON</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=375 height=427 src="FT_files/image037.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul Coulson has struck a deal with Ardagh Group bondholders
for shareholders to receive $300 million to walk away from the debt-laden
packaging group that the Irish entrepreneur built through decades of
acquisitions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ardagh, which is based in Luxembourg and makes glass bottles
and metal cans in Europe, the US and Africa, announced the restructuring deal
yesterday, capping more than a year of negotiations with creditors owed more
than $10 billion built up in the era of cheap money and low interest rates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Coulson is ceding control of Ardagh to a group of
bondholders under the terms of the deal, ending a decades-long streak as one of
the most significant figures in the European junk bond market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 72-year-old transformed Ardagh into one of the world’s
largest packaging groups through leveraged buyouts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While Coulson controls more than 50 per cent of Ardagh’s
voting rights, his economic stake is smaller at 36 per cent so he will receive
just over $100 million of the $300 million payout.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Control is set to be passed to Ardagh’s unsecured
bondholders as part of a debt-for-equity swap. The group’s riskiest $1.7
billion of payment-in-kind bonds will be fully written off in exchange for a
small minority stake in the business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bondholders will also provide $1.5 billion of new funding to
the group while a loan that Apollo Global Management provided last year will be
repaid in full.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Coulson’s investment in Ardagh began with a troubled airline
leasing business in the 1990s. After winning a payout from the investment bank
that advised on a soured acquisition that brought his company to its knees,
Coulson used the cash to acquire a stake in a small Dublin-based bottling
company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A series of debt-fuelled acquisitions over the next two
decades transformed it into one of the world’s biggest producers of glass and
metal drinks containers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ardagh’s frequent issuance of junk bonds made it one of the
largest players in Europe’s market for riskier debt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But interest rate and energy cost increases in recent years
have hit the highly levered business, which faces billions in upcoming
maturities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After creditors last month offered Ardagh shareholders $250
million to walk away, the Financial Times reported that Coulson had insisted on
them receiving $300 million to consider giving up the company, along with other
conditions around securing the money swiftly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The transaction will preserve the group’s ownership of its
glass and metal packaging businesses and puts in place a sustainable capital
structure with significantly lower leverage and an enhanced maturity profile,”
said Herman Troskie, Ardagh group chair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=363 height=400 src="FT_files/image038.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sirens blare, and giant red texts urge us to seek shelter
immediately. Nobody in Salzburg’s Haus für Mozart moves, because this is what
we're here for: Dmitri Tcherniakov’s reimagining of the crisis that
precipitates the action of Handel’s&nbsp;<i>Giulio Cesare in Egitto</i>. We're
already in the bunker. Together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tyrants, siblings, lovers, royals, associates: everyone is
thrown together in a series of interconnected concrete spaces. Every now and
then, a bomb falls above with a terrifying thud, and the walls reverberate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At first, Cornelia still finds time to fix her lipstick,
while Cleopatra preens and flirts. By the end, everyone on stage is smeared in
grime and traumatised — not because of the war above, but because of what these
people do to one another below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And although Tcherniakov earned a good storm of boos from
the opening night traditionalists at his curtain call, this is the real heart
of Handel’s opera.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The popular director has never tackled baroque music before,
but he has fully grasped the concept of affect, the notion of action that
propels its protagonist from one emotional extreme to the next. In his telling,
Cesare is a self-assured ruler, Cleopatra a calculating seductress, her brother
Tolomeo a cold-blooded psychopath, Cornelia (widow of Pompeo, Cesare’s rival) a
domineering mother to the damaged, fragile Sesto.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tcherniakov manages the action with skill, dramatic flair,
and unfailing trust in the score, somehow conjuring endless surprises from
familiar material. Countertenor Christophe Dumaux could have been born to play
Giulio Cesare, delivering a beefily masculine account of the virtuosic role — a
formidable achievement. Olga Kulchynska grows in stature as the evening
progresses; her Cleopatra has immense character, depth and passion. Lucile
Richardot has an oddly androgynous voice; her Cornelia shines more for her
nuanced acting. Dumaux inevitably blows his fellow countertenors out of the
water, with Yuriy Mynenko’s Tolomeo sounding initially insecure, and Federico
Fiorio’s Sesto underpowered — though the latter reveals wonderful agility and
delicacy in a voice that would be better suited to smaller venues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Le Concert d’Astrée plays well enough for conductor
Emmanuelle Haim, and she supports her singers faithfully, but her Handel is
insipid and flat. Slow movements pool and stagnate; she seems to have no
ability to shape leading voices with momentum, or phrase in a way that drives
the music forwards. There's little love for the small moment, and no great
insights into a score that demands better. Even the thrilling horn solo in
Cesare’s famous hunting aria sounds strained and over-controlled — a moment that
more mutual trust could have made electric.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Tcherniakov’s staging seems to flatten, the fault lies
with Haim; in other hands, this would be a consummately thrilling evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Herbie Hancock’s current, somewhat avuncular stage persona
makes much of his fellow musicians’ accomplishments while making light of his
own. Trumpeter Terence Blanchard, he said, has composed more than 60 scores for
film and TV and James Genus has held the bass chair on the Saturday Night Live

<p class=MsoNormal>Hancock’s opening words introduced the keyboard program he

that he’d been performing for over 50 years. Yet it was Hancock’s musical
vision that shaped the evening, his energy that brought the audience to its
feet and his strength of character that let his musicians’ prodigious talents
fly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hancock’s vast and varied catalogue spans 1960s acoustic
modernism and the avant-garde to world music, heavily amplified funk and
hip-hop. And he remains a forceful influence in the lineage of jazz piano. At

dipped into that huge back catalogue, referencing each strand and moulding them
anew into something contemporary and fresh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The repertoire was familiar and the line-up unchanged from
his previous Barbican show in 2023. An “Overture” of what he described as bits
and pieces had solos for all, while condensing a large chunk of recent musical
history into a riveting kaleidoscope of styles. Once more, Wayne Shorter’s
“Footprints”, rearranged by Blanchard, and Hancock’s “Butterfly” followed. But
with rhythms shifting, a stronger jazz vibe and themes either stretched or
played as hints, it was more than the band’s improvisations that made this
performance unique.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hancock maintained the watery squelches, howls and jungle
noises of the “prehistoric predator” program for a while before the band eased
in with rattles, taps and a quiet bass drone. Blanchard’s trumpet, full-toned
and clear, signalled funky moves, backbeats rattled bones and the performance
was underway. Soon, blaxploitation riffs morphed into fine-tuned modern jazz,
solos reached crowd-raising highs and an unaccompanied Lionel Loueke conjured
an entire band using the pedals of his guitar. Thirty minutes later, and
playing without pause, the band stretched out on an up-tempo, straight-ahead
“Chameleon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the night progressed, the rearranged “Footprints”
switched from playful bounce to night-time prowl and “Actual Proof” pulsated
with the youthful high-octane vigour of Jaylen Petinaud’s drumming — the
controlled virtuosity of the orchestrated solos he sprinkled through the set
were a highlight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The piece is now a standard bearer of classic jazz funk, but
its roots lie in a seductive ballad that Hancock wrote for the score of the
racially conscious spy spoof,&nbsp;<i>The Spook Who Sat by the Door</i>&nbsp;(1973).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Butterfly” followed, its theme stretched over a bed of
subtle funky beats, and then Hancock, half singing through a vocoder, noted
difficult times, the commonality of humankind and called for AI to be taught
ethical behaviour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The segue into Loueke’s unaccompanied, jaw-dropping blend of
fugue, funk and Beninese roots was seamless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The gig played out with a funky triptych of “Hang Up Your
Hangups”, “Spider” and “Rockit”, though once again, the band darted off at
tangents. A reprised and funky “Chameleon” was the closer, with Hancock on
keytar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For more than two hours, Hancock and his band had delivered
dazzling solos, emotional focus and uncanny mutual rapport. Hancock’s place in
history as stylist and composer has long been assured. This concert confirmed
him as a bandleader of stature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>European stocks slipped yesterday after an initial positive
reaction to the US-EU trade deal melted away and investors turned their focus
to the negative growth impact of the agreed tariffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The US and the EU reached an agreement on Sunday in which
the European bloc will face a tariff of 15 per cent on its exports to the US.
The EU has also agreed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on US energy
products and weapons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Stoxx Europe 600 index, which captures large-cap stocks
across the continent, reached its highest level since late March — before
Trump’s so-called “liberation day” announcement — rising as much as 0.9 per
cent at the open. But those gains faded through the day and the index closed
0.2 per cent down. Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax fell 1.1 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Technology stocks gained, however, as investors registered
their relief that semiconductors would face zero tariffs. Chipmakers ASML and
BE Semiconductor Industries both closed more than 4 per cent higher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Auto stocks fell, despite tariffs on the sector being
reduced from 27.5 per cent to 15 per cent under the new deal. A sub-index of

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Germany's n8n seeks $1.5bn valuation as Europe's AI
start-ups lure investors</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Ivan Levingston — London</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>German software start-up n8n is in talks to raise new funds
at a more than $1.5bn valuation, seeking to take advantage of growing investor
interest in Europe’s leading artificial intelligence groups.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Berlin-based company, which automates workflows using
AI, is speaking with investors about raising new money, according to people
familiar with the discussions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The talks come just four months after its last funding
round, which one person with knowledge of the deal said valued the group at
about €300mn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Europe’s start-ups are having success focusing on AI
applications and services aimed at businesses. Companies such as Synthesia,
DeepL, and Helsing are among those raising funds at multibillion-dollar
valuations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those familiar with n8n’s fundraising talks said the company
generated about $40mn of annual recurring revenues. At the time of its last
fundraising in March, n8n had over 230,000 active users and annual recurring
revenues had grown fivefold within the past year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The group could seek to raise more than $100mn in a new
round. Talks are continuing and no final decisions have been taken. n8n did not
immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It previously raised €55mn in its Series B round in March
led by Highland Europe and is backed by Sequoia, HV Capital, Felicis,
Firstminute and Runa Capital. Its customers include Delivery Hero and
StepStone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other European start-ups raising new investment include
France’s Mistral AI, which is eyeing a $1bn funding deal. Mistral has secured
new contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This month, Swedish start-up Lovable raised funds at a
$1.8bn valuation and surpassed $100mn in annual recurring revenue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Europe’s venture capital market has had a slow start this
year with total deals worth €29.2bn in the first half, according to PitchBook,
putting 2025 on track for a roughly 5 per cent annual deal value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Cycling adventure powered by whimsy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<img width=596 height=409 src="FT_files/image041.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whoever decided that&nbsp;<i>Wheel World</i>&nbsp;wouldn't
force you to mash buttons to keep pedalling, my keyboard thanks you. The
cycling game from California-based developer Messhof avoids the trope that
saw&nbsp;<i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i>&nbsp;ruin several of my
PlayStation 2 controllers — here you just hold down the space bar while instead
focusing on gear shifts, staying in the slipstream and trying very hard not to
hit traffic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Wheel World</i>&nbsp;is a racing game, albeit one
disguised in the cel-shaded whimsy of an indie adventure. The island of
Tramonto is home to all manner of motley challengers — pirates, chefs, robots,
farmers — keen to race you. Winning, beating times or acquiring letters
scattered across the racetracks in the style of old skateboarding games will
increase your reputation, unlocking more of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To what end? That’s a little harder to explain. You play
Kat, a blue-haired woman with eyes like fried eggs and no obvious back-story
beyond inexplicable cycling prowess. You awake one day in a grove of
rust-coloured trees, a big green monolith looming in the distance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inside you meet Skully, an immortal bike demon with cranial
form and an unimaginative name. Skully needs your help to ride the Chain of
Life, a celestial slipstream linking your world and the Moon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why you (and why at all) is not obviously clear, beyond the
fact that Skully couldn't find anyone else napping in a glade. But to help him,
you'll need to recover the various legendary bike parts — saddle, frame,
handlebars etc — that will grant you access to the Chain of Life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These were pilfered by renowned cyclists across Tramonto,
whom you'll have to race to win them back, all the while tricking out your
rusty old bike with upgrades.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bike has four stats: power, aero, handling and grip.
Sourced from neat yellow boxes that wash ashore like the FedEx packages in Cast
Away, or purchased using the currency imposed by a cycling mega-corporation, an
array of parts will increase or decrease these stats; it’s up to you to balance
or imbalance them in your favour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The racing itself is surprisingly satisfying, combining the
constant jostling and trash-talking of your opponents with the restful rhythms
of the sport. It helps that the island of Tramonto is a terribly picturesque
place, punctuated by bicycle vendors selling their wares from the pavements and
makeshift ramps to launch you over the vineyards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is not a bug-free experience — particularly when the game
insists that Kat jump back on her bike as soon as any dialogue ends, no matter
how hemmed in she is by obstacles. And there are the usual racing-game
frustrations that your AI opponents might not be working within the same laws
of physics that you are. But there is some neat attention to detail, too: the
vista from the main menu gliding neatly down to where you last left off, or the
shimmering soundtrack by indie record label Italians Do It Better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You wouldn't necessarily judge a Need for Speed or Burnout
game for its lack of plot. But&nbsp;<i>Wheel World</i>, with its sparky
dialogue and anti-corporate subtext, clearly aspires to something deeper. It is
quirky, idiosyncratic and fun, but that’s about as far as it goes. You may be
left feeling that it needs something else to drive it forward — something stronger
than just pedals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Volatility paradox as trading remains calm despite noise</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Rick Rieder — Markets Insight</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Markets are supposed to quake when policy shocks loom.
Tariff and geopolitical jolts should, in theory, push prices higher for
derivatives that insure against debt default and widen the spread of interest
rates of credit over benchmarks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, in 2025, the louder the headlines, the quieter the
market gauges of risk have become.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While there could be a small pothole of volatility ahead,
expectations of volatility implied by pricing on options contracts have fallen
for two years. The yield premiums offered to woo investors on bond issues match
pre-pandemic lows. And key indices of the cost of credit default swaps — which
act as a kind of insurance on debt — sit near long-term lows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why does anxiety coexist with such market pricing? Because
the US has quietly become one of the world’s most shock-resistant economies.
That resilience not only supports stocks, it also lets investors lock in
once-in-a-generation income on high-grade bonds that serve as a ballast
alongside riskier positions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Services now generate 81 per cent of US GDP and 69 per cent
of consumer spending, up from 38 per cent in the 1940s. Real services
consumption has contracted only twice year on year — in 2009 and 2020; the
higher the services share, the smoother the cycle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Digitised supply chains and flexible labour markets blunt
default risk and reduce earnings shocks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Households are stronger, too. Debt to net worth is near
all-time lows, 50 per cent below 2008 highs. And net worth stands at 7.6 times
disposable income — higher than anytime pre-pandemic. Total household interest
costs are under 10 per cent of income — lower than any pre-pandemic reading on
record. The average mortgage rate outstanding is just 4.05 per cent, keeping
interest payments at 4 per cent of income. Meanwhile, Americans have more
equity in their homes than ever before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Corporate balance sheets mirror that discipline. Investment
grade issuers spent the past decade lengthening the duration of their debt and
building cash. Household and business leverage is more than 30 per cent below
the Great Financial Crisis highs and profit margins sit at 13.8 per cent,
higher than any pre-pandemic reading on record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With no balance sheet faultline, forced deleveraging — the
kind that ignites volatility — never starts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Households hold financial assets worth $129tn with about
half sitting in assets yielding north of 4 per cent, meaning that reinvestment
needs become self-fulfilling. That cash hunt yields every day, creating a
persistent bid for corporates and securitised assets. Dealers keep lighter
inventories, trading spreads compress and price swings shrink.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a tariff scare earlier this year but the shock
fizzled. While risk premia are tight, yields are not. Treasury yields are still
above 4 per cent and inflation has cooled to just above 2 per cent. Positive
real yields after taking into account inflation are the richest for at least 15
years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A diversified portfolio of A rated debt earns 6-7 per cent
income with roughly 3 per cent volatility in price movements. Securitised
assets and private credit add equity-like returns with loss expectations akin
to investment grade debt. With selective use of options, fixed income returns
can plausibly reach high single-digits without chasing junk-rated debt. Such
returns are an attractive ballast for portfolios today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Simultaneously, breakthroughs in AI, cloud, robotics and
other productivity-enhancing forms of technology are creating unique upside in
equities. Valuations may look full but cash flow generation continues to
eclipse expectations. Record cash levels seen in money market funds, aggressive
corporate buybacks and a thin calendar of IPOs keep demand ahead of supply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Markets are not ignoring risk — they are pricing a system
built to absorb it. A service-oriented economy, fortress balance sheets and a
liquidity-rich investor base deliver a two-for-one: resilient growth and
elevated fixed income yields.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Investors should lean into this — maintain equity exposure
to ride durable earnings growth; tilt bond holdings towards the higher quality
end of the market; and augment portfolios with uncorrelated assets such as real
estate, private investments and even a measured allocation to crypto.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Done thoughtfully, the portfolio can compound at high
single-digit rates, even if geopolitical drama dominates the headlines. In
2025, the loudest noises come from headlines, not the trading floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The new industrial park on the edge of Tangshan, a gritty
manufacturing city near Beijing, has lofty ambitions to attract the country’s
most advanced companies.<br>
But so far, the mostly empty complex surrounded by lush cornfields has only
drawn a couple of auto parts producers, an ammunition case maker and a toll
collection equipment company.<br>
But that is not deterring local officials. Turning on the lobby lights to
reveal an extensive model of the park, a man who identifies himself only as
Zhao says the aim is to draw what China’s president, Xi Jinping, calls “new
quality productive forces” such as electric vehicle and battery makers.
Tangshan, he adds, “is seeking to shift from traditional manufacturing to
high-tech industries”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Copycat complexes are found in hundreds of lower tier cities
across China. Local government officials, desperate to meet their GDP growth
targets following a deep property slowdown, are driving investment into
favoured industries such as EVs, artificial intelligence, robots, batteries and
solar panels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The country is becoming so saturated with such projects that
Xi recently betrayed a rare note of exasperation at what Beijing calls&nbsp;<i>neijuan</i>,
or involution — excessive price competition. “Artificial intelligence,
computing power and new energy vehicles. Do all provinces in the country have
to develop industries in these directions?” Xi told the Central Urban Work
Conference, a high-level Communist Party meeting on urban development,
according to state media.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Economists have long warned that China’s state-directed
model of debt-fuelled investment risks the inefficient allocation of resources
and the crowding out of consumption, obstructing long term growth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet after its property bubble burst in 2021, China has
leaned more heavily than ever on investment, manufacturing and exports as
households — most of whose wealth is tied up in real estate — constrained their
spending.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s over-dependence on manufacturing investment has
taken on new urgency as excess capacity and weak domestic demand lead to one of
its longest periods of deflationary pressure since the 1990s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overcapacity has also become a global challenge for trading
partners, which worry about a repeat of the surge of Chinese exports during the
late 1990s and early 2000s. The US and the EU, along with large developing
countries such as Brazil and India, are rapidly erecting trade barriers to
prevent their own advanced industries being subsumed by a flood of low-cost
goods from China.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After previously denying the existence of overcapacity — Xi
during a trip to France last year said there was no such thing —&nbsp;<i>Qiushi</i>,
the Communist Party magazine, last month not only used the term but also laid
out a forensic analysis of its causes. A swath of measures to try to shore up
prices have followed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But with China’s investment in manufacturing still rising at
a blistering pace — up 7.5 per cent so far this year after a 9.5 per cent rise
in 2024 — there is no end in sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yan Se, assistant professor in the department of applied
economics at the Guanghua School of Management in Peking University, said at a
recent seminar that China's share of global manufacturing value-added could
rise to 40 per cent in the next five years, from about 27 per cent now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think it’s encouraging to see Beijing recognising this
[involution] as an important issue and something that is not just a headache
for China's trade partners but also poses challenges for China’s economy in its
own right,” says Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The question is, how much can really be done in the short
term?” he adds. “Because in order to alleviate the consequence of involution,
you need to probably have greater investment discipline and you need greater
domestic demand at the same time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You need to increase demand and reduce supply. And that’s
easier said than done.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s President Xi Jinping has encouraged ‘new productive
forces’ such as… electric vehicles, but heavy spending is not always fuelling
growth in the manner he envisaged.<br>
<i>FT montage/Getty Images</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Round the corner from Zhao’s complex, another new industrial
park touting itself as an “advanced manufacturing technology hub” is also
largely empty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The park has sold about 75 per cent of its properties to
companies that make firefighting, agricultural and other equipment, a manager
says. Most have yet to move in. Many of the factories seem to be temporarily
used to store construction materials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It might be because the economic situation in the past two
years has not been very good and demand has not been high as expected when the
land was purchased,” says a salesperson at the complex. “So now [the buyers]
want to rent it out again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The empty factories point to another big problem:
unproductive investment. Even though most are not yet equipped with machinery,
the buildings can still be counted as fixed asset investment in manufacturing,
economists say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tangshan is one of 40 Chinese cities sampled in a new report
from Yuhan Zhang, principal economist at the China Center of the Conference
Board. It found that many of China’s smaller cities were heavily dependent on
such investment to produce economic growth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Such conurbations had investment-to-GDP ratios on average of
58 per cent last year, compared to China’s already high national average of 40
per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Even with considerable excess capacity, local governments
are ramping up industrial and infrastructure investments to counteract weakness
in the property market,” Zhang said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The study also found that in lower tier cities, high
investment intensity usually coincided with weak labour productivity and lower
total factor productivity — a measure of output per input of capital and
labour. For policymakers in Beijing, the original idea of new quality
productive forces was not only to move Chinese industry up the value chain, but
also to improve total factor productivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Misallocated investment and duplicated capacity are
undermining efficiency,” Zhang wrote in the report, flagging that “long-term
gains… require human capital development, innovation, and more market-oriented
resource allocation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Top-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and
Shenzhen “have transitioned to economies centred on knowledge-intensive
industries, advanced services and global trade.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Heavy fixed-asset spending appears to reduce efficiency
rather than boost it, even if local governments are pouring money into ‘new
quality productive forces,’” Zhang concluded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the floors of China’s producing factories, life is
already a daily battle for survival against razor-thin or even negative
margins, as demand contracts and exports face tariff uncertainty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zhao Fen owns four toy factories, which produce original
merchandise and toys under licence from other brands. Chain-smoking in her
office in China’s southern industrial province of Guangdong, where she is
surrounded by Winnie-the-Pooh toys and anime figurines, she says the biggest
change in her business over the past decade was the rise of&nbsp;<i>juan</i>&nbsp;—
excessive competition — which has reduced the selling prices of her goods by
about half in that time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even in these more traditional sectors, competition has been
partly driven by the ideas behind new quality productive forces, which include
upgrading China’s older industries with new equipment, academics say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beijing has been running subsidy programmes for producers to
buy new machinery, supercharging production at a time when there is less
consumer demand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In the past, good things needed people to make them, but
now they are made by machines, and the overall production capacity has also
increased, so the unit price has also decreased,” Zhao complains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The industry is now so crowded with producers that profits
have become elusive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Making money is just the icing on the cake,” Zhao muses,
adding that her factories sometimes accept unprofitable orders just to ensure
that they can retain their workforce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She also complains about IP theft, echoing long-standing
complaints from western manufacturers. “The market is too good at copying...
it’s not that the control and prevention of copying in IP products is not
strict in China... but there are many people who take advantage of loopholes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It is because of this that the entire industry has been
squeezed to the point that no one has any profits... Unless we are all
consolidated into one group... I think it is very difficult for the country to
control this. There is no way to control it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If we don't build a social welfare society… then
deflationary pressures will be structural. This rat race will be long-term.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similar situations confront producers higher up the value
chain. At the China International Supply Chain Expo in Beijing this month, Li
Congjun, salesman manager at Expo New Materials, said traditional plastics
products were facing “significant price pressure.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Companies tried to develop new products but innovation often
needed support from government policies to get off the ground. “In practice,
policies often seem like ‘loud thunder but little rain’ — the actual support
isn’t very strong,” said Li, whose Wenzhou-based group makes engineering
plastics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A government trade-in programme for consumers, in effect a
subsidy to buy products, had helped but the market “is still not as robust as
during the era of real estate prosperity, four to six years ago,” Li said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One manager at Jiangxi Jinghang Aviation Forging &amp;
Casting, a state-owned enterprise affiliated with China's aerospace company
Avic, said at the event that his firm had tried diversifying into automotive
work, “but this industry became too competitive, with more and more
participants and almost no profit, so we abandoned this sector.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, the company was trying to generate more foreign
sales, with its eye on European aircraft maker Airbus as a potential customer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Excess capacity and over-competition are not new phenomena
in China, which has experienced bouts of&nbsp;<i>neijuan</i>&nbsp;during the
1997-98 Asian financial crisis, the 2009 global financial crisis, and between
2012 and 2016, due to the stimulus-driven over-investment that followed the
financial crisis. During that last bout China embarked on “supply side
reforms”, shutting down or consolidating capacity in steel, cement and other
sectors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mirroring that last effort, the government has again begun
intervening in some industries. The State Administration for Market Regulation
(SAMR), China’s competition regulator, in July ordered internet shopping
platforms Ele.me, Meituan and JD.com to participate in competition “rationally”
— the second such warning in two months.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similar government guidance has been provided to the solar
and car industries while the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
has said it will soon release a plan to stabilise growth in 10 key industries,
including steel, non-ferrous metals, petrochemicals and building materials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On July 24, SAMR and the powerful National Development
Reform Commission went further, unveiling a draft amendment to the country’s
price law that would ban companies selling below cost and stopping them from
using data and technology for improper pricing practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, academics say it was easier for the government to
reduce overcapacity when it was concentrated in sectors full of
state-controlled enterprises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now we have oversupply pressure in very advanced
investment, including EVs and batteries and solar panels and soon,” says Tang
Yao, an associate professor of applied economics at Guanghua School of
Management.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This time around, these companies are mostly private... we
will have to rely on a market approach.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He adds the government has already said it wants to improve
“fair competition” — code for removing subsidies and tax rebates, especially at
the local level, and building what Beijing calls a “unified national market.”
This would constrain local administrations from competing with each other by
differentiating themselves using special subsidies and protection for favoured
companies in their jurisdictions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beijing “understands that in order to reduce the
involution-style competition of the nation, first you have to control the
behaviour of local governments,” Tang says. If subsidies were limited, then
uncompetitive companies might naturally exit the market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yan, also of Peking University, says ultimately, Beijing
needs to address China's thorniest problem: how to rebalance the economy
towards higher domestic demand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One big obstacle to that is the need to provide sufficient
social welfare, unemployment and retraining benefits to help existing workers
make the transition from traditional sectors to more sophisticated work.
Without this, local governments will be reluctant to shut down older or
loss-making factories for fear of job losses that threaten social stability and
GDP growth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So if we don't build a social welfare society, if we don’t
provide people with better benefits, deflationary pressures will be long term
and structural. This rat-race will be long-term,” Yan says.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But while these themes are debated in Beijing, in regional
cities such as Tangshan local officials remain as determined as ever to move up
the value chain into the hottest sectors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last year, 71 new robot manufacturing companies set up in
one of Tangshan’s high-tech zones, local state media reported, bringing the
total to 238 as of March 2025. Robots, particularly those powered by AI, are
another of Beijing’s top priorities for development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zhao, at the first industrial park, says that while local
authorities would drop subsidies according to the central government’s wishes,
they could still help companies setting up in the region with funding from
local government finance vehicles, particularly for “high-end projects

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The world is failing the Palestinian people</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As starvation stalks Gaza, western allies must press for end
to Israeli offensive</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rarely has the world had such visibility of mass human
suffering as in Gaza. Images from the besieged Palestinian enclave are
graphically displaying the death and destruction wrought by Israel’s nearly
22-month offensive. Women clutching horribly emaciated children. War-scarred
hospitals struggling to treat streams of wounded. The dead lined up in rows in
body bags. Mass starvation is stalking the strip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet Israeli soldiers have killed hundreds of people trekking
to aid distribution centres operated under a flawed Israeli- and US-backed
system that breaks with usual humanitarian models. The number of Palestinians
killed by Israel’s offensive is nearing 60,000, according to local health
officials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Across the strip, entire towns have been razed, with most of
the 2.1mn population herded into barren wastelands. Israeli defence minister
Israel Katz has told local media he wants to establish a “humanitarian city” in
southern Gaza to house 600,000 people and later the entire population.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Israel first launched its offensive, most of the world
stood by a nation traumatised by the abhorrent October 7 2023 attack by Hamas,
the Palestinian militant group, that killed 1,200 people. Other nations
supported Israel’s right to self-defence, to hold the perpetrators to account
and to attempt to secure the release of 250 hostages seized. Hamas should have
released all hostages long ago. Its use of them as bargaining chips is
despicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Israel's offensive has long gone beyond all bounds of a
proportionate response. The longer it has continued, the more it has borne the
hallmarks of a vengeful assault by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
far-right government to destroy the very fabric of Palestinian society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pattern is repeated, on a lesser scale, in the occupied
West Bank. Israeli military operations and Jewish settler violence have forced
thousands from their homes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A small but increasing number of genocide scholars are
concluding that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide. On Monday,
B’Tselem, a respected Israeli rights group, reached the same verdict. In a
report, it said Israel’s policy and “its horrific outcomes ... leads to the
unequivocal conclusion that Israel is taking co-ordinated action to
intentionally destroy Palestinian society in the Gaza Strip.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israel bitterly rejects the allegation. But evidence of
ethnic cleansing is mounting, with the population forcibly displaced multiple
times under the threat of military action. Aid is also indisputably being
weaponised, and an entire community collectively punished for Hamas's appalling
actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet Israel’s western allies still refuse to take the
necessary steps to pressure Netanyahu to end its war — above all the Trump
administration, which has the most leverage. Other western nations’
condemnations are not enough. Unless the Israeli government agrees to an
immediate end to the war and a surge of aid into Gaza, western countries should
be sanctioning Netanyahu and his government. They should halt all arms sales to
Israel. More should follow French President Emmanuel Macron’s lead and recognise
a Palestinian state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arab nations could also be doing more. Egypt, Jordan, the
United Arab Emirates and others that have relations with Israel should make
clear those diplomatic ties cannot be sustained without a radical change of
course.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israel this weekend announced “tactical pauses” and
“humanitarian corridors”, in a sign that Netanyahu’s government is not immune
to outside pressure. But it is far too little, far too late. The world is
failing the Palestinian people — a failure that will haunt western nations in
particular for years to come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The Lionesses triumph is all about the money</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Stephen Bush</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=339 src="FT_files/image044.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>England’s second successive victory at the women’s European
football championship is the result of many things: elite coaching, team spirit
and a little bit of luck. But it is also a triumph of money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since the first women’s Euros I watched — in which England
were eliminated 6-2 by Germany — the amount spent by both the Football
Association and England's elite clubs has skyrocketed. In 2009, Rachel Williams
had been working full-time as a plasterer just months before the start of the
tournament. Eni Aluko worked part-time as a lawyer. In contrast, in 2025, the
starting XI are full-time footballers, many of them with a host of endorsements
and sponsorship deals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>England is not alone in spending more money on women’s
football — it’s not a coincidence that the final was between England and Spain,
who also contributed the clubs (Arsenal and Barcelona) for the Champions League
final a few weeks ago, which was also won by the English side. But some of the
biggest clubs in world football aren’t spending more on women’s football out of
a philanthropic desire to band together to beat diabetes or other ailments
caused by sedentary lifestyles. It’s because they believe there is money to be
made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Previous successes have provided a downpayment on that
belief. The surge in attendances after England’s victory at the Euros in 2022
now means that Arsenal’s home games in the league take place at the
60,000-seater Emirates Stadium, where the men’s team play, not the
4,500-capacity Meadow Park in London’s exurbs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dream of football’s moneymakers — that the phrase
“women’s football” might one day be as redundant as referring to “women’s
tennis” when you talk about the stars of that game — looks, if not in immediate
reach, to be a plausible target to aim for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question is whether that success will mean changing the
game in ways that long-standing supporters find alienating. Football
administrators have seen expanding the audience for women’s football as about
targeting two groups: persuading people, largely men, with a pre-existing
attachment to a football club, to attend both men’s and women’s games, and
attracting people without an interest in men’s football, largely women, to
games for the first time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Significantly cheaper tickets — my season ticket is £110,
behind the goal, while the same seat for the men’s game costs £1,127 — mean
there are many more families with children, and often people will bring guests
who support other teams. From this season, fans in certain parts of the stadium
will be able to drink alcohol at their seats, which they can’t do at men’s
matches. The dreaded video assistant referee (VAR), which drains some of the
fun and energy out of the stadium experience, has not yet come to the women’s
game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The league’s major players and struggling teams are not a
carbon copy of the men’s top flight: Arsenal’s opening game this year is
against the London City Lionesses, a women’s club without a male affiliate.
Although England's Premier League markets itself “LGBT-friendly” in all
circumstances, it is at women's matches you will see same-sex couples arm in
arm, in a way that is rare in the men’s game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That’s not to say, as some condescending coverage does, that
we are all sweetness and light. One reason I like to sit, or rather stand,
behind the goal is to barrack the opposition goalkeeper, and during last
season, the march to the stadium was often accompanied by graffiti calling for
the struggling head coach, Jonas Eidevall, to leave or be sacked. Although you
can no longer make out the solitary voice of the particularly angry man who
used to vent his displeasure at poor performances at Meadow Park, now when
performances drop the mood in the stands can be mutinous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the question for long-term fans is whether the
distinctive delights of the women’s game can thrive and survive alongside the
game’s growth. Will my £110 ticket soon be a thing of the past? Can the game
attract large crowds on a par with the men while maintaining its relaxed
relationship to booze and equal love? Can it command big television audiences
while the match day experience remains unblighted by VAR? Or will all these
joys disappear, as have the days when you could enjoy a cup of tea, a hot dog, a
chat with the catering staff and be back in the stands before the end of
halftime in Meadow Park?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These questions all suggest a broader uncertainty around the
women's game: we know the reason why we are able to watch the finest generation
of women’s footballers yet seen is because of more money and more interest in
the game. But it remains to be seen if there is a route to the rewards and
prestige enjoyed by the men’s game that doesn’t involve taking on its more
dispiriting aspects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Global AI rivalry is a dangerous game</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Julian Gewirtz</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On a phone call with Donald Trump days before his 2025
inauguration, Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, told the incoming
president that the US would achieve human-level artificial general intelligence
during his term in office. Altman has framed this achievement as part of an
existential AI race between the US and China. The desire to win this contest
explains numerous US government actions — from the Biden administration’s
export controls on China to the $500bn “Stargate” data centre project to the action
plan that Trump released last week to accelerate AI development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both countries are investing heavily in the technology. But,
outwardly at least, they appear to be pursuing different goals. While US
leaders prioritise developing the most intelligent models possible, Chinese
policymakers are most focused on AI’s widespread application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To use Silicon Valley parlance, the Chinese Communist Party
seems far less “AGI-pilled” than their American counterparts. Although leading
Chinese labs like DeepSeek, Zhipu, and Stepfun state their ambitions to reach
AI that can equal the abilities of the human mind, top Chinese government
officials barely address AGI.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For one, the Chinese government lacks an official term that
captures what Altman and others mean when they say AGI. The term used in China
is&nbsp;<i>tongyong rengong zhineng</i>, the precise translation of which is
“general-purpose AI”. This suggests a system applied to many uses rather than
human-level intelligence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nor is the Chinese government taking obvious steps to create
the physical infrastructure necessary for AGI. It has been slow to build the
“superclusters” of computing chips that US hyperscalers are constructing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead, Xi Jinping has emphasised applying AI to practical
purposes. He has consistently said that China’s AI sector should be “strongly
oriented toward applications.” From industrial robotics to products like Manus,
a leading AI agent, this is already becoming a reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Xi has, however, openly embraced the goal to “catch up and
surpass” the US in science and technology, including in AI.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So why not AGI?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One explanation is that US export controls have seriously
inhibited China's ability to obtain vast amounts of computing power needed for
future AI models. Another possibility is that Chinese officials may see AGI as
an abstract construct and not imminent, preferring to focus on more tangible
goals. If Silicon Valley is wrong and human-level AI remains out of reach then
China’s focus on applications will look prescient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is, however, a third possible and more worrying
explanation for China’s approach: the perennially secretive CCP might be
concealing its interest in AGI. This would not be a new phenomenon: China has
engaged in the largest nuclear weapons build-up since the Cold War, but it does
not publicly acknowledge the scale of this expansion. The CCP might fear
stronger US policy responses if it were to openly declare its interest in AGI.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What this means is that even if the US and China are running
what look like different races in AI, direct competition remains intense.
Whether Xi doubts AGI, feels constrained, or is concealing his intentions,
there is a profound risk on both sides of “technological surprise” — when a
rival gains an unexpected technological capability, it can escalate the risk of
conflict.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If Altman’s timeline is right and the US rapidly attains
human-level AGI to Beijing’s surprise, then China might fear the irretrievable
loss of strategic competition. It may act to reclaim it using multiple levers
of power — including offensive cyber operations, coercion, diplomatic pressure,
and even military force.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alternatively, if China’s leaders are hiding their AGI
efforts then the US could be on the receiving end of an ugly shock and take its
own actions to redress the balance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These scenarios drive home a key strategic insight: in
isolation, both the intensification of US-China rivalry and the explosion of AI
breakthroughs are world-changing. Together, their simultaneity and
interconnectedness create unprecedented risk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Policymakers around the world are ill-prepared to manage
these combined strategic and technological developments. Many struggle to stay
up to date with AI developments, let alone plan for the geopolitical
ramifications of new breakthroughs. But they must prepare — now to mitigate
these risks. The coming years will be far more dangerous than many of the
technology’s investors and policymakers realise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Spending 5 per cent on defence doesn’t make Nato stronger</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Minna Alander</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bar for last month’s Nato summit in The Hague was
unusually low: it can be considered a success that the alliance survived the
summit intact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As expected, the main result was the European pledge to
spend 3.5 per cent on defence and 1.5 per cent on defence-relevant
infrastructure by 2035, bringing the total spending by European countries to 5
per cent of GDP — the number Donald Trump had demanded some months earlier. The
spending pledge seems to have pacified the US president for now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But while no one disputes that Europe needs to do more, the
focus on how much is spent instead of what it is spent on is harmful. It
distracts from what Europe should really be focusing on: capability development
and interoperability. Indeed, making Europeans commit to an arbitrary defence
spending target is the best way to keep Europe from reaching strategic
autonomy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, given the vastly different sizes of European
economies, spending 5 per cent of GDP on defence is going to mean vastly
different results in terms of the combat effectiveness it produces. For
comparison, Germany's GDP is €4.3tn, meaning a defence budget of more than
€200bn at 5 per cent spending. Estonia’s GDP is a little less than €40bn,
meaning 5 per cent amounts to just under €2bn. The situation looks similar for
the other two Baltic states, Latvia and Lithuania, which are most at risk if
Russia expands its war into Nato territory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the defence spending will be not only unequally, but
counter-intuitively, distributed. European Nato allies' capabilities are built
where they are most urgently needed. A contribution to Baltic air defence could
be considered as part of the German presence in Lithuania.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, it is not smart to spend a lot if you can spend
less. Trying to meet a goal sum rather than capability targets creates
incentives to pay a lot instead of focusing on outcomes. Ukraine, for example,
has learnt to produce equipment cheaply and at large scale. National defence
spending targets do not encourage better co-ordination and co-operation in the
EU, which is crucial in a highly fragmented and inefficient defence industrial
base. Efforts to co-ordinate demand and supply for more coherent procurement
and production are therefore more important than any spending target.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A high spending goal does not automatically encourage
cost-effective arrangements such as the reserve-based conscription armies
common in the Nordic-Baltic region. Unlike professional forces, reservists are
not missing from the regular workforce and pensions do not eat up a large share
of the defence budget. In Belgium, Bulgaria and Italy, nearly 20 per cent of
defence budgets go on pension payments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There has been some progress. The European Investment Bank’s
recent rule change to allow it to lend or invest indirectly in companies. This
would give the industry space to succeed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Third, such a spending target will inevitably lead to
creative accounting. Italy has already said it will start counting pensions as
part of its defence budget. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has
suggested counting climate action as defence spending. Nato allies are,
fortunately, allowed to count their military support for Ukraine towards the 5
per cent, which creates an incentive to maintain that. But the spending target
applies only to European allies; the US is not incentivised to resume its military
aid to Kyiv.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, rather than pumping in more state funding to the
European defence industry through rigid and slow public procurement procedures,
it would be better to streamline regulation of defence industrial markets and
encourage more private investment — as with the European Investment Bank’s
recent rule change to allow it to lend or invest indirectly in companies. This
would give the industry space to succeed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Western liberalism’s waning star</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Edward Luce</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=410 src="FT_files/image045.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The laws of hydraulics are broken. Donald Trump’s approval
ratings have dropped to second-term lows yet the Democratic party’s have fallen
even further. They ought to be soaring. Just a third of Americans approve of
them. Much the same can be said of centrist and centre-left parties across the
west. The odd one out is Canada. That is because Mark Carney’s Liberal party is
the staunchest defender of Canada’s sovereignty — the opposition having been
too cosy with Trump. But Canada is the exception that proves the rule. Western
liberalism is still on the retreat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where liberal democratic parties are in power, normal
hydraulics still work. A year after taking office, Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour is
lucky to poll at 25 per cent. Nigel Farage’s seven-year-old populist Reform
party is meanwhile attracting almost a third of voters. Less than three months
after taking office, Germany's two big parties are neck and neck with far right
Alternative for Germany. This is in spite (or maybe because) of the fact that
German intelligence recently branded AfD as rightwing extremist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In France, Marine Le Pen’s far right Rassemblement National
likewise polls streets ahead of the other parties in spite of Le Pen having
been debarred from running in the next presidential election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of the major European nations, Italy’s hard right Giorgia
Meloni has the highest approval rating. Even Trump, who is sinking into a
self-created doldrum, has his head above water. His recent 37 per cent Gallup
rating is well above the Democratic party. When the left is in office,
populists make hay. When the right holds power, the left rarely do. For further
evidence, see Benjamin Netanyahu's Israel and Narendra Modi’s India.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That there are multiple causes of western liberalism’s
malaise makes it harder to fix. Complexity encourages infighting. Long after
Taylor Swift hits retirement age, Democrats will still be arguing over whether
Joe Biden was too old to run, or too selfish to step down sooner. They might
also still be debating whether the left is too woke or not woke enough. Can the
left in office do more to improve the economy for the blue-collar classes? Does
immigration enrich society or further squeeze the working class? Should there
be a wealth tax? Is Israel committing war crimes? Such questions reliably
divide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beyond the internal divisions, contemporary liberalism has
two character defects that augur badly for its resurgence. The first is lack of
conviction. It is all very well pointing out the dangers of Trump, Farage, Le
Pen and others. It would be negligent not to. But making the negative case is
not enough. “I might not be beautiful but have you seen that ugly person next
to me?” said no winner of a beauty contest ever. “Stronger together”, “When we
fight, we win” or campaign variations thereof do not mask the uncertainty
beneath. As Bill Clinton once said, strong and wrong always beats weak and
right. Focus groups cannot solve this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Western liberalism’s second defect is intolerance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>American liberals were at their worst during the pandemic.
That anti-vaxxer conservatives were even crazier should be no comfort. One day,
it seemed, Dr Anthony Fauci was telling America that masks were not essential.
The next, Rochelle Walensky, then head of the Centers for Disease Control was
insisting that two-year-olds should be masked all day. Anyone entertaining the
theory that the virus might have come from a Wuhan lab was dismissed as
Sinophobic or worse. In December 2020, when vaccines became available, the
Chicago Teachers Union tweeted, “The push to reopen schools is rooted in
sexism, racism, and misogyny.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone could agree back then that otherwise liberal Sweden
was foolish to take the herd immunity route. That Sweden ended up with one of
the lowest mortality rates in Europe has not been similarly highlighted. Covid
is not ancient history. Any survey probing why so many young voters are turning
right that excludes their pandemic experience is wasting time. The road to
recovery starts with looking in the mirror. The seminal book, <i>In Covid’s
Wake: How Our Politics Failed Us</i>, by two Princeton scholars should be
compulsory reading across the spectrum. That it has not been reviewed by most
major newspapers is troubling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As go social distancing rules, so goes free speech.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Liberals said, “Follow the science”, which confused science
with faith. Science is a trial and error process that only works with openness
to dissent. The same applies to political debate on campus, within newspapers,
at think-tanks and society at large. To many younger voters, particularly men,
today’s liberal establishment looks more like a conservative one. Educated
elites confect orthodoxy on what we should say and do. The resemblance to high
Victorianism is more than passing. Victorians regulated manners and etiquette.
They also dreaded the mob. Expanding religions look for converts. Waning ones
hunt down heretics. In form and content, western liberalism is dangerously
close to the latter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The good news is that liberalism has rebounded before after
losing self-belief. The bad news is that it took a genocidal second world war
to rediscover its necessity. Hoping that humanity is on a learning curve is not
a strategy. The positive case for liberal democracy in today’s world is still
waiting to be heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>China's textbook approach to the tariff talks with the US</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beijing has subtly transformed the impending August 12
deadline to meet a durable tariff agreement with the Trump administration
(“China at the negotiating table”, Unhedged, FT.com, July 23) from a hard
cut-off into a negotiable pause, opting to offer a tariff “freeze” rather than
a full rollback.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By framing their proposal as a temporary suspension, China
retains room to manoeuvre domestically, where monetary and fiscal tools are
already stretched, and maintains the narrative of strength at home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the same time, Chinese envoys signalled modest capacity
reductions in steel and other industries as symbolic concessions, a tactic that
reinforces mutual obligation without ceding the appearance of control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This careful orchestration echoes the principle of guanxi:
each small gesture deepens interdependence, keeps US negotiators engaged and
allows Beijing to dictate the pace of talks rather than simply react to
Washington’s timetable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beyond these surface moves, China has quietly shifted
attention to critical supply chains, reminding its counterpart that disruption
of rare earth magnet exports (where it supplies about 90 per cent of the world
market) would have immediate, tangible effects on US manufacturing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By highlighting this less visible pressure point, Beijing
injects time sensitivity into the dialogue and reframes the discussion around
securing essential inputs, not just tariff levels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For negotiation specialists, it’s a textbook demonstration
of creating visible tariff concessions buy goodwill and headlines, while
strategic control of vital materials ensures deeper stakes remain on the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In doing so, Chinese negotiators preserve the option to
tighten or loosen pressure in response to US proposals, keeping themselves
firmly in the driver’s seat of a more balanced, multi-dimensional negotiation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most conversations about AI governance focus on compliance

that data was collected and labelled with fairness and accuracy in mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We’ve seen how easily assurance can become a box-ticking

<p class=MsoNormal>Without visibility into data sourcing, labelling and human

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Volkswagen embodies the challenge ahead for European
industry</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Editorial Board</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Volkswagen, the German automotive giant, has long stood as a
symbol of industrial might and engineering prowess. But recent developments
underscore the mounting difficulties faced by European manufacturing in the age
of global competition, digital transformation and the green transition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>VW’s recent announcement that it would scale back production
of its electric vehicles and suspend a number of battery projects in Europe is
telling. While demand for EVs is growing, it is not doing so fast enough to
meet the group’s original projections. Chinese rivals, meanwhile, are flooding
global markets with cheaper, technologically advanced electric models, backed
by state subsidies and years of strategic planning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This exposes a broader issue: Europe’s industrial base is
being squeezed from all sides. On the one hand, it must invest massively in new
technologies — from EVs to green steel — to meet environmental goals and remain
competitive. On the other, it faces higher energy prices, regulatory burdens
and sluggish domestic demand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The US has responded to similar challenges with the
Inflation Reduction Act, a massive programme of subsidies and tax breaks aimed
at revitalising American manufacturing. China, as noted, is using state
capitalism to back national champions. Europe, however, remains divided on how
far it should go in offering state support or loosening fiscal rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Volkswagen’s predicament illustrates the limits of relying
solely on market forces to drive transformation. While competition is vital, it
needs to be complemented by targeted public investment, clear industrial
strategy and a willingness to support companies through periods of structural
change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Europe’s policymakers must face these realities head on.
That means streamlining regulation, investing in infrastructure, improving
access to finance for green technologies, and ensuring that the energy
transition does not price industry out of global markets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>VW’s difficulties should be a wake-up call. If even its
scale and resources are insufficient to navigate the current industrial
landscape, smaller players will face even greater hurdles. European industry
can still compete globally — but only if it is given the tools and environment
to adapt.</p>

treacherous stretch of Montmartre’s cobblestone streets in the last stage of
the Tour de France on Sunday — a postcard-perfect finish to the popular
sporting event, won this year for the fourth time by the Slovenian Tadej
Pogacar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fans packed Rue Lepic, adding yet another page to the
history of a key artery that has long symbolised the artistic, rebellious
spirit of Montmartre, a neighbourhood which was once a windmill-dotted village
considered too far from central Paris to bother with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inspired by the cycling event at the Paris Olympics last
summer, the race organisers added the circuit up Rue Lepic and around the
basilica of Sacré-Coeur to spice up the usual closing sprint along the
Champs-Elysées.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is hard to be grouchy about all this when the spectacle
reminds one of how stunning Paris can be. And yet, some residents of Montmartre
fear that this reconfigured final étape of the tour will only fuel the rampant
tourism that has transformed their neighbourhood into a background for people's
social media posts. “Tourists come to consume the place, take a few photos, and
rush off,” says Anne Renaudie, longtime resident and member of a group
advocating for the livability of the neighbourhood. “They treat Montmartre like
an amusement park.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Renaudie is part of a burgeoning movement of Montmartre
residents pressuring the city to preserve their quality of life instead of
chasing tourist dollars. While critics dismiss such complaints as predictable
from those who live in an area where real estate prices are among the city’s
highest, the residents do have a point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The growing flows of visitors to Montmartre have already had
ripple effects: boulangeries being replaced by high-end clothing stores, tour
buses clogging narrow streets, and schools closing as families get priced out
by Airbnb. The area’s morphing into a strip of souvenir shops holds a certain
irony given it was once a bastion of socialist radicalism under the Paris
Commune.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I live only a 10-minute walk from Sacré-Coeur but in my
neighbourhood, charm gives way to grit as the entrenched problems of noise,
dirtiness and crime reappear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some tourists end up there, perhaps tricked by the physical
proximity to Montmartre or attracted by lower prices. I often wonder if they
regret not staying amid the ersatz old Paris bistros and accordionists playing
Edith Piaf’s “La Vie en Rose”. Is the historical caricature better or today’s
flawed reality?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The negative consequences for people who live in tourist
hotspots are obvious, as shown by protests in recent years from Barcelona to
Venice. But there seems to be little way to curb arrivals, save perhaps for the
whole thing to become so unpleasant that the tourists just stop coming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cities have become over-reliant on tourism revenues.
Parisian property owners cannot resist the higher yields earned from short-term
rentals, especially since the city has strict rent controls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is the Netflix effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the 2001 movie&nbsp;<i>Amélie</i>&nbsp;brought people
to Montmartre, Netflix has turbocharged tourist flows. The picturesque Maison
Rose restaurant, once frequented by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali, is now met
with a constant stream of&nbsp;<i>Emily in Paris</i>&nbsp;fans who stop here to
mark where the eccentrically dressed Emily laments having to close her social
media accounts. A bakery featured in the animated kids’ show&nbsp;<i>Miraculous</i>&nbsp;has
also become submerged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some canny marketers will probably soon offer tours to
capitalise on the new addition to the Tour de France. In fact, the race has
always been symbiotic with tourism, which was founded in 1903 by a sports
newspaper seeking to increase sales. By broadcasting the country’s most
beautiful landscapes to a global audience, the event has become a powerful
promotion tool, so much so that local governments still pay for the tour to
loop through their towns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mayors in lesser-known corners of France do not need to
worry about overtourism, but Montmartre surely needs no more promotion. It
might be time to turn the cameras off, whether they belong to the Tour de
France, Netflix or TikTok.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Heathrow’s third runway might be good value</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=602 height=853

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s a billion or two, or 10 even, between friendly
investors? Heathrow airport will this week publish detailed plans for a
privately financed third runway. Rumours and guesstimates run as high as £60bn.
The world’s most expensive airport — a regular airline gripe — should assume
the brace position for an onslaught of headlines and incredulity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>British sensitivity is extremely high when it comes to
infrastructure investment. Between the debacle of the pared-back High Speed
Rail 2 plans, which are now expected to cost £80bn, and the long-running debate
over nationalising Thames Water, whose private owners loaded it with
unsustainable debt, trust is low in the management skills of both officials and
the private sector when it comes to public goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heathrow, whose largest shareholder is French private equity
group Ardian, has already come under fire this month after submitting a
separate £10bn investment proposal to its regulator. Covering plans for the
five years from 2027, Heathrow’s backers would invest £2bn in fresh capital.
Airlines — for which read their customers, mostly — would face a 17 per cent
increase in the average landing charge per passenger over that time. The spend,
Heathrow says, would include a big expansion in terminal space and an increase
in passenger capacity of 10mn, or about 12 per cent from 2025 targets. Airlines
have called the costs excessive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The numbers making the rounds are big. But not all the
spluttering is justified. Airport expansions don't come cheap. Dallas Fort
Worth last year announced a $9bn upgrade plan, promising a big transformation.
New York’s JFK is in the middle of a $19bn redevelopment, pledging sparkling
new terminals and snazzy streamlined processes. Singapore's Changi airport,
regularly voted the world’s best, is getting a new runway and an additional
terminal for some S$13bn (£8bn).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These plans look less pricey than Heathrow’s, but these
airports are not as constrained by space and the need to build up or tunnel
down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heathrow’s investors received their first dividend this year
since the Covid-19 pandemic. The airport has held off confirming further
payouts as it waits for regulatory input on its spending plans. The most
impressive number in its first-half report was that 98 per cent of passengers
spent less than five minutes waiting at security.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No entertaining holiday or business travel stories start
with a saunter through check-in, security and boarding. But airport headlines
don't just have to be about things that go wrong, either. The success of the
cross-London express Elizabeth Line, albeit two decades in the building and
billions over budget, shows big transport projects can still wow for the right
reasons. Would that Heathrow, whether it spends £10bn or multiples of that with
third runway approval, ends up following that example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tesla’s $16.5bn contract won’t be enough to drive a
revival at Samsung</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=369 height=484
src="FT_files/image047.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Samsung could use the break. It has roundly disappointed on
a couple of quarterly earnings. It fell behind in high bandwidth memory, used
to improve efficiency in AI workloads by Nvidia and its ilk, ceding ground to
local rival SK Hynix. Its foundry chipmaking business is barely in the
rear-view mirror of its bigger Taiwanese rival: TSMC’s 67.6 per cent market
share dwarfs Samsung’s 7.7 per cent on TrendForce numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chip plants depend on a virtuous cycle: the more the
customers, the better the yields, the bigger the profit bounty, the greater the
reinvestment — and so on. So far, Samsung's foundry business is on the reverse
ride.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Particularly needing a helping hand is Samsung’s new Texas
plant, which risked becoming a white elephant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Impressed investors — who had already driven up Samsung’s
share price by almost a third this year on turnaround hopes — bumped it up a
further 6.4 per cent on the Tesla deal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That looks premature. For an industry that thrives on big
numbers, the eight-year contract is pretty paltry: $2bn a year for a company
expected to reap sales of $230bn this year, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ,
represents roughly three days’ sales.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, it is possible that Musk, in effect limited to a small
number of suppliers, is keeping them on their toes. Tesla awarded TSMC the
contract for its last generation of chips; the previous AI4 chips are made by
Samsung. Indeed, while contract terms are not disclosed, it seems likely that
Tesla got a good deal. Samsung would have every incentive to offer sweet terms
at a plant operating with plenty of slack. Busier TSMC would have less reason
to be similarly accommodating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>True, Tesla brings other perks: a marquee name on the
factory to woo other big-name buyers and a side of management consultancy since
Musk plans to drop by and assist in maximising production efficiency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But, by itself, it will fall short of driving a revival.
Samsung’s other units, including smartphones, face their own pressures. Recent
share price strength, a tad ahead of the broader benchmark of which it is a big
chunk, means its price relative to next year’s earnings is now above most
peers’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only by catching up with rivals’ tech and winning back more
big customers can Samsung get back on track.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>European electricity grid operators turn money into power</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=372 height=482 id="Picture 1"
src="FT_files/image048.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once may be an accident and twice a coincidence but three
times is most definitely a trend. Spanish utility Iberdrola last week joined
the UK’s National Grid and Belgium’s Elia in raising money for new investments
in electricity grids. The group’s €5bn equity raise will not be the sector’s
last.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Electricity networks in Europe and the US need huge
investment. In Europe, grids tend to be older. And the continent’s commitment
to clean energy — which means more electric vehicles and heat pumps — entails
big increases in transmission and distribution capacity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, European networks will attract €800bn of capital
expenditure between 2024 and 2033, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated last year,
sharply increasing the asset base on which their regulated returns are
calculated. Iberdrola reckons its network assets will increase from more than
€51bn at the end of this year to over €90bn by the end of 2031. That’s a 10 per
cent compound annual growth rate. The UK and US account for a big chunk of the
new investments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some utilities will opt for fresh equity because they
already run a tight financial ship. Cutting dividends is unpopular with
investors in a sector traditionally bought for its defensive qualities and high
yields. Iberdrola’s net debt to EBITDA ratio is 3.3 times, Mediobanca said. SSE
and E.On are more highly geared on RBC numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The good news is that raising equity to fund growth is not
unpopular with investors. National Grid’s huge £7bn rights issue last year
caused the stock to crash but it has since recovered. That ought to be
especially true for Iberdrola, which thinks regulators will allow it to set
tariffs for its networks such that it makes a nominal post-tax return of 9.5
per cent on the new money it has raised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That allowed it to sell shares in an accelerated
bookbuilding at a discount of less than 5 per cent to the previous day’s
closing share price last week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The appeal of companies that build electricity networks in
Europe is not yet reflected in their shares, which typically trade at a
pedestrian mid-teens multiple of expected earnings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Utilities in general are defensive with long-term
investments and returns set by regulators. But electricity grid builders, given
their role in the energy transition, are poised for rapid growth in both assets
and earnings. That’s a powerful combination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Volkswagen embodies the challenge ahead for European
industry</b><br>
<i>Arno Antlitz</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Europe’s automakers face mounting problems. For over a
decade, an industry historically associated with technological and engineering
excellence has concealed less flattering truths about high costs and stagnating
output. Now faced with a trade conflict and accelerating Asian rivals, the
ability of Volkswagen and others to restructure is a litmus test for whether
European industry can remain globally relevant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our company embodies the challenge ahead. For too long we
have operated under the assumption that growth would offset rising costs and
under-utilised capacity. Fuelled by profits from China and strong sales of
premium brands such as Porsche and Audi, Volkswagen tried to grow its way out
of the problem instead of addressing structural inefficiencies. When demand
softened, the consequences became clear — declining margins, idle factories,
and fast-moving rivals first from the US and now China grabbing share on their
home turf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this is not just Volkswagen’s challenge. The auto
industry remains a pillar of Europe’s economy. According to McKinsey,
manufacturers, suppliers, finance providers and after-sale care services
together account for 7 per cent of Europe’s GDP and support nearly 14mn jobs
across the continent. The sector also drives wider growth: every euro invested
generates more than twice that in added value in the broader economic
landscape. The risks of decline go far beyond any single company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Carmakers’ woes also reflect a deeper, long-term issue:
Europe’s widening productivity gap. Over the past 25 years, labour productivity
growth in the US has outpaced that of Europe by at least a percentage point on
average per year. Today, the consequences are stark. According to Goldman
Sachs, labour productivity per person employed in the US is, adjusted for
purchasing power, between 35 and 45 per cent higher than in France, Germany and
the UK — and the divide continues to grow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Volkswagen Group is confronting these challenges head-on
with tough decisions. We have reduced production capacity by 750,000
automobiles in our German plants. We have limited wage growth. And we are
reducing our workforce by 35,000 in Germany alone by 2030 to boost productivity
both in terms of labour and capital. These steps are necessary in a world where
competitiveness is non-negotiable. At the same time, we are investing
decisively in the future, allocating €165bn over the next five years to drive electrification
and digitalisation while expanding into areas such as autonomous driving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But one thing has become clear: investment alone is not
enough. Structural reform must come first — both at Volkswagen and in the EU.
Without changing how we work, build and organise, even the boldest investments
will fall short. Industrial competitiveness depends on core efficiency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Priority reforms for the EU include more flexible labour
markets and smarter regulation that supports rather than stifles innovation. It
also means being pragmatic: securing access to critical raw materials and
adopting technology partnerships where speed matters more than
self-sufficiency. That’s why Volkswagen and others have entered tech-focused
joint ventures with partners in China and North America. The goal: to speed up
development of software, architecture and platforms — while scaling faster and
reducing costs, instead of building everything in-house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of this requires more ambition. Europe must become a
place where bold ideas are not just researched but industrialised and scaled up
across a common market. “Profit” should not be something we need to excuse. It
is the foundation for a sustainable business model and for securing jobs and
prosperity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Draghi report on European competitiveness set the right
tone. But speed, nostalgia, and bold adaptation over complacency, performance
over rigid tradition — these must be guiding values.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To move forward, we must now choose structural reform over
complacency, performance over rigid tradition. The future of European industry
depends on it.</p>
