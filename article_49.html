promises more aid</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><i>FT Reporters</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">US President Donald Trump has said for the first time that
“starvation” is afflicting people in Gaza as he pledged to get more food into
the territory, saying he was working on “various plans” with the Israeli
government.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Speaking with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as they
held talks in Scotland yesterday, Trump said the images he had seen of
malnourished children were real, despite claims from Israel’s Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu that there was no starvation in the strip.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“That’s real starvation stuff,” Trump said. “I see it, you
can't fake that.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Those children look very hungry,” he added, describing what
he'd seen on television. “We have to get the kids fed.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The comments will increase pressure on Israel to expedite
deliveries of aid into Gaza, as the UN and other bodies warn of the acute risk
of famine. Gaza’s health ministry has reported more than 80 “famine and
malnutrition-related deaths” in July, including 14 yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Starmer described the situation as “an absolute catastrophe”
and said “people in Britain are revolted... at what they are seeing on their
screens. So we have got to get to that ceasefire.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Taking questions at Turnberry, one of Trump's Scottish golf
courses, the president spoke primarily of short-term plans to get more food aid
delivered but was vague on the details.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Downing Street had earlier said Starmer would present a “UK
plan” for “sustainable peace” in the Middle East to Trump after discussing the
proposal with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel
Macron at the weekend. London said Starmer and Trump had agreed “to work
together to bring an end to the misery and starvation.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Merz said Israel “must also do its part” to improve the
situation, underlining how the staunch supporter of Israel has adopted a more
critical stance towards Netanyahu’s government.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But the European plans appeared to have gained minimal
traction with Trump, who was non-committal on what might happen in the next few
days.</p><p class="MsoNormal">He said Washington would help “set up food centres where
people can walk in with no boundaries,” in apparent criticism of the US-funded
Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Local officials say more than 1,000 people have
been killed trying to reach aid in recent months, many in attacks by Israeli
troops while trying to reach GHF sites.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>FT View page 14</i></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
