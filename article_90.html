revival at Samsung</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="484" src="FT_files/image047.png" width="369"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">Samsung could use the break. It has roundly disappointed on
a couple of quarterly earnings. It fell behind in high bandwidth memory, used
to improve efficiency in AI workloads by Nvidia and its ilk, ceding ground to
local rival SK Hynix. Its foundry chipmaking business is barely in the
rear-view mirror of its bigger Taiwanese rival: TSMC’s 67.6 per cent market
share dwarfs Samsung’s 7.7 per cent on TrendForce numbers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Chip plants depend on a virtuous cycle: the more the
customers, the better the yields, the bigger the profit bounty, the greater the
reinvestment — and so on. So far, Samsung's foundry business is on the reverse
ride.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Particularly needing a helping hand is Samsung’s new Texas
plant, which risked becoming a white elephant.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Impressed investors — who had already driven up Samsung’s
share price by almost a third this year on turnaround hopes — bumped it up a
further 6.4 per cent on the Tesla deal.</p><p class="MsoNormal">That looks premature. For an industry that thrives on big
numbers, the eight-year contract is pretty paltry: $2bn a year for a company
expected to reap sales of $230bn this year, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ,
represents roughly three days’ sales.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Next, it is possible that Musk, in effect limited to a small
number of suppliers, is keeping them on their toes. Tesla awarded TSMC the
contract for its last generation of chips; the previous AI4 chips are made by
Samsung. Indeed, while contract terms are not disclosed, it seems likely that
Tesla got a good deal. Samsung would have every incentive to offer sweet terms
at a plant operating with plenty of slack. Busier TSMC would have less reason
to be similarly accommodating.</p><p class="MsoNormal">True, Tesla brings other perks: a marquee name on the
factory to woo other big-name buyers and a side of management consultancy since
Musk plans to drop by and assist in maximising production efficiency.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But, by itself, it will fall short of driving a revival.
Samsung’s other units, including smartphones, face their own pressures. Recent
share price strength, a tad ahead of the broader benchmark of which it is a big
chunk, means its price relative to next year’s earnings is now above most
peers’.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Only by catching up with rivals’ tech and winning back more
big customers can Samsung get back on track.</p></body></html>
