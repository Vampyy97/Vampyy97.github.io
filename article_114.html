KANA INAGAKI — LONDON</p><p class="MsoNormal">Renault is set to name its procurement head Francois Provost
as its next chief executive, choosing a close ally of former boss Luca de Meo
after his shock departure to luxury group Kering a month ago.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Provost was expected to be confirmed as CEO when Renault’s
board met today, people familiar with the matter said. They cautioned that the
decision had not yet been finalised and could be subject to change.</p><p class="MsoNormal">He would be a surprise choice ahead of Dacia boss Denis Le
Vot, who was considered favourite for the role. Former Stellantis executive
Maxime Picat was also a contender for the position.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Provost has been the group’s head of procurement,
partnerships and public affairs since 2023. He has handled sensitive issues
including the group’s reworking of its alliance with Japanese carmaker Nissan
in 2023 and set up partnerships with Chinese group Geely and Saudi Aramco.</p><p class="MsoNormal">He joined Renault in 2002 after starting his career in the
French government and has also worked for the carmaker in senior roles in
Russia, South Korea and China.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The decision comes six weeks after the departure of de Meo
to lead Kering. During his tenure, de Meo engineered the group’s turnaround by
revamping its cost structure and strengthening its product line-up.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company has also been less exposed to the US trade war
and the loss of market share among foreign brands in China. But this month,
Renault issued a surprise profit warning in the wake of weaker than expected
sales in June. It now expects an operating margin of about 6.5 per cent for
2025, compared with its earlier forecast of 7 per cent or more.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Following de Meo’s departure, Stellantis poached Renault’s
chief designer Gilles Vidal to head the design of the group's European brands.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The nominations committee, which includes a representative
of the French government, is expected to meet this morning, after which
Provost’s name will be put before the board.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Renault said: “The selection process is ongoing and is very
well advanced. Discussions with all stakeholders are currently taking place in
order to finalise the choice.”</p></body></html>
