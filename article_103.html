AIMEE WILLIAMS — WASHINGTON</p><p class="MsoNormal">France is pushing for champagne and other wines and spirits
to be exempt from US tariffs as European officials seek to extract carve-outs
in a trade deal due to come into force on Friday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">An agreement reached by the EU with US President Donald
Trump on Sunday has created confusion in Brussels and Paris over which products
will be free from a 15 per cent tariff on most European goods imported by the
US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">EU officials insist that talks with Washington are
continuing, including on alcoholic beverages. But US officials have said there
will be no carve-outs for spirits and wines, including champagne.</p><p class="MsoNormal">French junior trade minister Laurent Saint-Martin has
suggested France is close to gaining an exemption for cognac and other spirits.
“We understand spirits are indeed exempted,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But a finance ministry official said they were trying to
exclude all alcoholic beverages from the new tariff.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“I can just tell you that we seem to be more advanced on
spirits than on wines but we are continuing the engagement here,” an EU
official said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A senior EU diplomat suggested that spirits had secured an
exemption, while wine was still being discussed. France is by far the biggest
EU exporter of alcohol to countries outside the bloc. In 2024 it exported
€12.1bn of alcoholic beverages, according to Eurostat, accounting for 41 per
cent of total alcohol exports. About two-thirds of this was wine and the rest
spirits, with the largest being cognac. Almost a third of French alcohol
exports go to the US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Its push for carve-outs has been supported by Italy, the
EU’s second-biggest exporter of alcoholic drinks, which exported €6bn of
alcohol in 2024.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The lack of clarity over the carve-out for European alcohol
exemplifies a broader confusion over the specifics of the deal.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Most EU exports to the US will be covered by a 15 per cent
standard rate but the commission has said it secured exemptions for aircraft
and aircraft parts, certain chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and natural
resources.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But factsheets explaining the deal by both the commission
and the White House have contradicted each other on issues such as steel
tariffs and pharmaceuticals. Neither document mentions beverages.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The commission said the final details would be reflected in
a joint statement, likely to be released on Friday, when Trump is also expected
to sign executive orders enacting the tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Both the French government and opposition politicians have
criticised the EU-US accord, although Finance Minister Eric Lombard defended it
as the best possible outcome in a bad situation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Wine and spirits groups have warned that additional tariffs
could prove critical for the industry. Ignacio Sanchez Recarte,
secretary-general of CEEV, the European wine industry group, told the Financial
Times that the sector “has been living in great uncertainty” since Trump
threatened a 200 per cent duty in March.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The French association of wine and spirits exporters said:
“A catastrophe has been avoided but the coming days will be crucial.”</p></body></html>
