STEPHEN FOLEY — NEW YORK</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Trump administration’s procurement chief has vowed to
persist with a Doge-inspired pricing squeeze on technology groups and
government suppliers, after some of the US’s largest corporations complained to
the White House about his aggressive approach to cost-cutting.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Josh Gruenbaum, a former investment banker and director at
KKR who runs the powerful Federal Acquisition Service, has overseen a
months-long review of multibillion-dollar deals with software providers and
consultancies, convincing companies including Booz Allen Hamilton, Google and
Oracle to offer steep discounts on services.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But Gruenbaum’s sometimes brusque approach — demanding that
the likes of Microsoft, Amazon and Uber identify savings or face the possible
cancellation of lucrative contracts — has sent shockwaves through the tech and
consultancy industries. A letter from Gruenbaum sent to 10 leading consulting
firms in March demanding they justify each individual government contract read:
“A 15-year-old should be able to understand what service you provide and why it
is important — no consultative jargon or gobbledegook.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">At least one chief executive complained directly to the
White House over the approach, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p class="MsoNormal">One leading US tech group said dealing with the
administration was impossible, and described it as a “circus”. “They are super
aggressive and have upset CEOs and others,” another government contractor told
the Financial Times. They added that airline industry executives were the
latest to complain about the FAS after learning their sector was the next to be
targeted.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a recent interview with the FT, Gruenbaum claimed all
negotiations had taken place in good faith. “I can’t think of a single
contentious or caustic discussion I've had with industry.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The General Services Administration, which houses the FAS,
claims the procurement review has resulted in more than $52bn in savings, of
which about $12bn comes from consulting contracts. The total figure accounts
for more than a quarter of the purported savings by the so-called Department of
Government Efficiency, or Doge.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Gruenbaum insisted his team’s approach was “going to persist
for the duration of this administration”. He added that multibillion-dollar
deals were still being reviewed against cheaper options.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We have shrewd business folks around us, we do run market
comparisons,” said Gruenbaum, whose role became more prominent after an
executive order further centralising procurement. “We have typically other
vendors who are like, ‘we could create proper market tension.’”</p><p class="MsoNormal">He warned companies that “volume’s going to start shifting”
if government suppliers failed to offer value for money on existing contracts,
“and I think industry understands that.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Gruenbaum denied the White House was pressing him to go easy
on companies with close ties to the administration, such as Larry Ellison’s
Oracle.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The buy-in from … the administration, for us to go and
execute on these things, that’s what’s making this happen,” he told the FT.
“We're not here to, like, just knuckle-drag people,” he said. “There’s a way to
get to a great deal where it’s a win-win, where you recognise ... how important
of a customer the federal government is.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The White House did not respond to a request for comment on
the complaints by chief executives.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a subsequent statement, Gruenbaum defended his team’s
approach, saying: “We are tough, but fair, and we take our jobs safeguarding
American taxpayer money extremely seriously — we make no apologies for that. We
stand by our record of success.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
