stablecoins” inaccurately portrays stablecoins as inherently destabilising.
This characterisation is unnecessarily alarmist and overlooks the rigorous
consumer safeguards established by the US Genius Act (FT View, July 22).</p><p class="MsoNormal">Far from repeating the chaotic monetary conditions of the
19th century, the Genius Act mandates that stablecoins must be fully
backed by cash, liquid US Treasury securities or bank deposits. It also
requires stringent reporting and strict compliance standards, substantially
mitigating systemic risks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Stablecoins do not inherently threaten traditional banking.
Instead, they streamline payments, reduce operational costs and enhance
financial inclusion. Recognising these advantages, many traditional
institutions are already exploring stablecoin integration to improve
efficiency.</p><p class="MsoNormal">You mention the attempt to “boost a number of get-rich-quick
schemes, including by the Trump family itself”. But suggesting a sinister
motive is unfair and misrepresents genuine policy consensus. Broad bipartisan
backing underscores the strategic value policymakers place on stablecoins for
advancing US financial innovation and maintaining global economic leadership —
not promoting speculative interests. Ultimately, the Genius Act exemplifies
thoughtful policymaking, balancing innovation with robust oversight. Other
nations would benefit from considering this balanced approach, rather than
dismissing it prematurely.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kristin Smith President, Solana Policy Institute; Former CEO
