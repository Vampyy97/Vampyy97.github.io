Pyongyang</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="286" src="FT_files/image052.jpg" width="601"/></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="223" src="FT_files/image053.png" width="174"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">North Korea has said relations between its leader, Kim Jong
Un, and President Donald Trump are "not bad", signalling a
willingness to enter talks with the US administration for the first time.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, a senior regime official, said a
resumption of dialogue with Washington was possible, adding that the
"personal relationship between our head of state and the present US
president is not bad", North Korean state media reported yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But she insisted that any US attempt to persuade her country
to give up its nuclear weapons would be regarded as "nothing but a
mockery", highlighting North Korea's military strength.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"The recognition of the irreversible position of [North
Korea] as a nuclear weapons state and the hard fact that its capabilities and
geopolitical environment have radically changed should be a prerequisite for
predicting and thinking about everything in the future," Kim Yo Jong said,
according to North Korea's state news agency.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump, who met Kim Jong Un on three occasions during his
first term as president, claimed in March that his administration was in
"communication" with Pyongyang. He also described North Korea as a
"big nuclear nation" and praised Kim as a "very smart guy".</p><p class="MsoNormal">But Pyongyang appeared to ignore Trump's overtures.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Analysts noted that Kim had left a summit with Trump in
Hanoi in 2019 bitterly disappointed after the collapse of negotiations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">North Korea is far less isolated than it was during Trump's
first term as a result of worsening US-China relations and Pyongyang's
deepening ties to Moscow after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Jeongmin Kim, executive director of Seoul-based information
service Korea Risk Group, said that despite North Korea's stronger military and
diplomatic position, the prospect of even tacit US recognition of its right to
possess nuclear weapons remained a tantalising reward.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"From Pyongyang's perspective, North Korea being
treated as a serious nuclear power on a par with Russia and China is a prize
worth pursuing."</p><p class="MsoNormal">She added that Kim Yo Jong's apparent openness to the
resumption of talks with the US stood in contrast to her brusque dismissal of
South Korean efforts to engage.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lee Jae Myung, South Korea's new leftwing president, has
made a series of conciliatory gestures in recent weeks, ordering his country's
military to cease broadcasts across the inter-Korean border and likening the
historic adversaries' relationship to a troubled marriage in need of
counselling.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kim Yo Jong mocked Seoul's "sweet remarks" on
Monday, accusing Lee's government of "pretending they do all sorts of
righteous things to attract our attention".</p><p class="MsoNormal">She also condemned annual joint US-South Korean military
exercises due next month as "aggressive".</p><p class="MsoNormal">Jeongmin Kim said North Korea's rejection of Lee's charm
offensive was, in effect, "bidding up the price" to improve
inter-Korean relations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"The trap has been laid for Lee," she added.
"If he continues his outreach efforts then he will look naive but if he
tries to convince the Americans to take a softer line he will look weak, and if
he shifts to a harder line then he will look insincere"</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
