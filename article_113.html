2025 final on Sunday thrilled fans of the Lionesses but the longer-term prize
could be a surge of investor interest in women’s football leagues and clubs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Club officials, advisers and investors told the Financial
Times that the women’s tournament, which featured record prize money of €41mn
as well as record attendances, could win more fans, and attract brands and
ultimately investors to the women’s game.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Euro 2025 has demonstrated that women's football has
cross-border appeal, not just a local or national following,” said Ebru Koksal,
chair of campaign group Women in Football and adviser to women’s sports-focused
investment firm Mercury13.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The tournament attracted a record attendance of more than
657,000 fans across the group stages and knockout ties. The stakes are high
since Europe’s domestic leagues and clubs will aim to carry the momentum into
the new season, with investors watching closely.</p><p class="MsoNormal">If new fans transfer to the domestic game, brands and
broadcasters should follow, in theory boosting investor demand and valuations,
said Andrew Umbers, co-founder of London-based sports advisory Oakwell.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Euros final attracted a peak audience of more than 16mn
viewers on BBC and ITV, a statistic that “very publicly” demonstrated the size
of the audience of women’s football in England, he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Umbers thinks Euro 2025, organised by Uefa, will boost
investor appetite for “top-level” women’s football clubs. In particular, he
expects “the floodgates to open with respect to investment” into clubs playing
in the Women’s Super League, the highest level of the game in England.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However, Jennifer Haskel, a sports expert at consultancy
Deloitte, cautioned that the Lionesses’ success “doesn't necessarily mean that
everything’s going to be picture perfect from now on”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We still need to continue to build and continue to showcase
growth from ... new fan engagement, new ticket strategies, new commercial
strategies that are specific to the women’s game,” she said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">More investment would follow what has been a flurry of
high-profile deals in the women’s game, including the $250mn takeover of Los
Angeles-based Angel City FC, which plays in the US National Women’s Soccer
League, by Bob Iger and Willow Bay in 2024.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Advisers and club executives pointed to efforts by English
clubs to attract external investment to their women’s teams.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of social media platform Reddit,
bought a roughly 8 per cent stake in the Chelsea women’s team for about £20mn
in May, valuing the WSL champions at around £250mn. Everton and Aston Villa are
also exploring the possibility of bringing external investors into their
women’s teams, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Chelsea,
Everton and Aston Villa declined to comment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sarah Batters, managing director of WSL team London City
Lionesses, says that, in light of these developments, the national team’s
triumph is a “boost at the right moment”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“There’s probably more reason for hope of an upward
trajectory and not just a flash in a pan,” she said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Michele Kang, owner of London City Lionesses since December
2023, is betting more widely on women’s football. She has also taken over the
Washington Spirit in North America’s NWSL and French team OL Lyonnes, and has
led a $2mn investment in women’s football boot specialist IDA Sports.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kang’s Kynisca Sports International is among the new breed
of investors targeting women’s football. Mercury13, which bought Italy’s FC
Como Women last year, is seeking more investments in the women’s game. Monarch
Collective, which also focuses on women’s sports, launched in 2023 and is an
investor in Angel City FC among other NWSL teams.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However, one sports banker, who preferred to remain
anonymous, cautioned that women’s football clubs, particularly in Europe, faced
an uphill battle to be profitable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">He said that a wider risk in European football, including
the men’s game, was that many clubs relied on owners to inject capital.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The 12 clubs in the WSL reported an aggregate pre-tax loss
of £28mn in 2023-24, according to Deloitte. Revenues rose 34 per cent to £65mn
in the 2023-24 season, while wages increased 44 per cent to £52mn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Experts say it will take time for revenues to catch up with
the valuations being negotiated with investors. Koksal believes the test is
whether fans who enjoyed moments of national pride at the Euros continue
watching the club game at stadiums and on media platforms.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“This will lift club valuations and expand investor interest
well beyond the UK,” Koksal said.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
