American physiologist realised that starvation would surely follow but that
little was known scientifically about its effects. Ancel Keys, a Minnesota
University professor and consultant to the US War Department, seized the chance
to fill in the gaps.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In 1944, together with the psychologist Josef Brozek, he
recruited 36 healthy male volunteers willing to be observed, measured,
questioned and assessed as they were first starved and then fed back to health.
The Minnesota Starvation Study became a landmark investigation into how extreme
food deprivation affects the human body, mind and spirit.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Along with accounts of such atrocities as the Bengal Famine
and the Holocaust, the study has informed a science of starvation that remains
hauntingly relevant today. A UN-backed body that tracks food security said
yesterday that “widespread starvation, malnutrition and disease” are driving
hunger-related deaths in Gaza, with the territory on the brink of famine. More
than 20,000 children have been treated for acute malnutrition and at least 16
have died.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Keys’ volunteers, all conscientious objectors, responded to
a wartime appeal entitled: “Will You Starve That They Be Better-Fed?” For the
first three months, the men, who lived in Keys’ lab, ate about 3,200 calories a
day. They had to walk 22 miles a week and keep a journal. Throughout, Keys
measured their weight, size and strength; there were X-rays, treadmill sessions
and blood samples, as well as intelligence and personality tests.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For the next six months, calorie intake was roughly halved
and comprised two daily meals of simple foods like toast and potatoes. The men
lost around a quarter of their body weight and 40 per cent of muscle mass; they
became weak, argumentative and introverted. They suffered dizziness, swollen
ankles, anaemia, hair loss, low libido, skin changes and ringing in the ears;
they felt cold, even in summer, and dropped out of classes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Heart rate and blood pressure fell, challenging the idea
these were largely fixed characteristics. They became obsessed with food (after
the experiment, Keys reported, three became chefs). Thirty-two of the 36 men
lasted the distance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The last three months focused on replenishing calories; the
volunteers admitted to finding this as challenging as being semi-starved. They
found it hard to regulate appetite, with several eating until they vomited;
many struggled with overeating after returning to normal life. Keys and
co-authors gathered their findings in <i>The Biology of Human Starvation</i>,
published in 1950 and still cited today for its relevance to eating disorders.</p><p class="MsoNormal">When interviewed two decades ago, the 18 then-surviving
Minnesota volunteers insisted they had no regrets about their ordeal and did
not think it had harmed them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The problems Keys encountered in treating starvation were
echoed in a 1951 study of liberated Japanese prisoners of war; a fifth died
after being fed. This phenomenon, also seen in Holocaust survivors, is known as
“refeeding syndrome”: a sudden influx of nutrients can trigger a potentially
fatal imbalance of fluids and electrolytes in a long-starved body.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Many starving people consume much less than half the
calories they need. When the glucose from regular meals runs out, a famished
body will eventually turn on itself, scavenging fat and then protein, including
muscle. While we are evolutionarily adapted to periods of hunger, prolonged
starvation weakens the tissues, such as heart muscle, that keep a person alive,
and increases vulnerability to disease.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Studies suggest an adult can survive without eating for
around two months as long as they are drinking water. Starvation is more
catastrophic for children, especially in the first 1,000 days of life, because
it hampers growth, brain development and immunity. Famine damages future
generations in the womb: children born to starving mothers are more likely to
develop obesity and diabetes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Keys, who died in 2004 aged 100 and became best-known for
designing army rations and linking cholesterol to heart disease, also made
wider observations that resonate with events today. A paper in the <i>Journal
of Nutrition</i> notes he “stressed the dramatic effect that starvation
had on mental attitude and personality, and argued that democracy and nation
building would not be possible in a population that did not have access to
sufficient food.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">As Keys saw hunger turn healthy men into living ghosts
lacking hope, he came to understand that starvation was a political issue, as
well as a scientific one.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
