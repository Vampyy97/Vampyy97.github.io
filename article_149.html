split in US policy-setters</h2><p class="MsoNormal">The US Federal Reserve held rates steady yesterday despite
pressure from Donald Trump and signs of a cooling economy. Two Fed governors
voted against the central bank’s rate-setting decision for the first time since
1993, as it held rates at 4.25 to 4.5 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The central bank’s decision came hours after second-quarter
GDP data pointed to a slowdown, even as it beat economists’ expectations and
bounced back from a first-quarter contraction.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While the votes against the decision by Christopher Waller
and Michelle Bowman were the biggest dissent on rates by Fed governors for over
three decades, two members of the broader Federal Open Market Committee opposed
the majority in a vote in 2019.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The FOMC warned growth had “moderated” over the first half
of the year, suggesting officials are edging towards backing cuts at future
meetings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Official figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis
yesterday showed the economy grew at an annualised rate of 3 per cent in the
second quarter, up from a 0.5 per cent contraction in the previous period.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The number was driven higher by a sharp drop-off in imports
as Trump’s levies came into effect, while a rush by companies to purchase
foreign goods in the first three months of the year sharply reversed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">With little more than a day to go before an August 1
deadline to wrap up deals with US trading partners, Trump is threatening to
impose heavy tariffs on nations that fail to reach agreement with the US, a
move economists say could trigger more turmoil.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump hailed the GDP figure as “WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED!”
and reiterated calls for Fed chair Jay Powell to reduce interest rates.
Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the growth countered “disinformation and
whataboutism” against the administration's policies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The president has ratcheted up pressure on Powell to lower
borrowing costs, deriding him as a “numbskull” and “stubborn mule.” In a highly
unusual move, Trump last week paid a visit to the Fed premises in Washington,
where he rebuked Powell over the cost of a $2.5bn refurbishment project.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The clash marked the most public rupture between a US
president and Fed chief since the central bank gained its independence from
government in 1951.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Powell and most other members of the Federal Open Market
Committee have argued that the economy still remains strong and that the
central bank needs to assess the effect of Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs on
inflation before reducing borrowing costs from restrictive levels. Analysts
said yesterday's headline GDP figure was driven by big swings in imports and
masked an underlying slowdown in the economy. Michael Gapen at Morgan Stanley
said that “volatility in trade flows” had “artificially suppressed” growth in
the first quarter before boosting it in the second. “We suggest looking under
the hood for signals about where the economy is,” he said. “The US economy has
lost considerable momentum this year,” added Christoph Balz at Commerzbank.
Overall, the economy grew at a 1.1 per cent annualised rate in the first half
of 2025, compared with 2.9 per cent in the second half of the previous year,
according to Financial Times calculations.</p></body></html>
