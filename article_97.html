risk losing credibility when trying to win over the rest of the world on
Russia's war in Ukraine, Norway's foreign minister has warned.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Espen Barth Eide told the Financial Times that the west
risked being perceived as cherry-picking international law instead of applying
principles "consistently" to various global conflicts.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"[By] very correctly criticising Russia, which has
broken every rule in the book, but until recently being very quiet on Gaza that
tells other parts of the world that we are not really seeing these as absolute
norms but more like a menu that we can pick arguments from."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Norway, together with Spain and Ireland, recognised
Palestine as a state last year and has sharply criticised Israel's military
actions in Gaza as it pushed the enclave to the brink of starvation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Barth Eide called the conditions in Gaza "worse than
hell on earth" at the weekend, before travelling to New York for a meeting
at the UN about a two-state solution.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Norway's foreign minister said he kept "reminding my
colleagues" that of the 8bn people on the planet, only about 1bn lived in
the west. Many in Europe had under-appreciated the linkage that other parts of
the world made between Russia's war against Ukraine and Israel's conduct in its
war against Hamas.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"We would be well advised to try to understand what
they think, and what many out there think is an inconsistent application of
international law," he added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Norway, a founding member of Nato as well as a border
country of Russia, is dramatically increasing military spending in response to
Moscow's attack on Ukraine. But the Scandinavian country is also an important
peace negotiator in global conflicts, including brokering the Oslo Accords
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization 30 years ago.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Oslo has faced heavy criticism from the Israeli government
for its recognition of Palestine as a state and other comments on the Middle
East. Barth Eide said he was aware of all the difficulties of a two-state
solution in the region, but that it was "very hard to imagine something
better".</p><p class="MsoNormal">Barth Eide added: "We are fully cognisant that a state
does not magically appear because you recognise it. That's why we all thought
recognition would be at the end of a [peace] process. But we changed our view
and [President Emmanuel] Macron changed the French view, [because] there isn't
a process. There haven't really been talks since 2013."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Macron has said his country will recognise Palestine in
September. British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said yesterday that the UK
would also recognise a Palestinian state in September unless Israel took
immediate steps to end the crisis in Gaza.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The EU has not adopted sanctions against Israel over its
actions in Gaza because of disagreements among member states. A review of the
association agreement between Israel and the EU in June found that Israel was
probably in breach of its human rights obligations.</p></body></html>
