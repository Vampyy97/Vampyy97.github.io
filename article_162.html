After an emergency
cabinet meeting lasting about 90 minutes on Tuesday, the UK prime minister put
Britain on a path to recognising Palestine as a state, probably as soon as
September.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For the ruling Labour party’s MPs and cabinet ministers who
have lobbied Starmer to take this decisive diplomatic step for months, there
was huge relief, coupled with frustration it had taken so long. “He was
pushed,” said one senior Labour MP. That is strongly denied by Starmer’s
allies, who insisted the prime minister was just waiting for the moment when
recognition of a Palestinian state would have the most impact. “It was always
when, not if,” said one.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Starmer has frustrated many in the Labour party, not just
left-wingers, over his handling of the Gaza crisis and what some MPs have seen
as a lack of urgency in his response to the grim scenes there.</p><p class="MsoNormal">When French President Emmanuel Macron announced last week he
would recognise Palestinian statehood at the UN General Assembly in September,
that frustration with Starmer turned to anger. “Number 10 had loads of incoming
fire over the weekend,” said a minister. More than 130 Labour MPs signed a
letter calling on Starmer to move now to Palestinian state recognition.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Starmer’s aides insisted that the end result of Tuesday's
cabinet meeting was “100 per cent unity” behind a position that is most likely
to see Britain recognise a Palestinian state around the time of the General
Assembly. “One way or another you get to Palestinian recognition,” said one
Starmer ally, after the prime minister set out a “UK plan” for a stable peace
between Israelis and Palestinians, which he hopes will win wide international
support.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Under Starmer’s plan, Britain will recognise a Palestinian
state in September unless Israel takes “substantive steps to end the appalling
situation in Gaza,” agrees to a ceasefire and commits to a long-term,
sustainable peace based on a two-state solution. Dame Emily Thornberry, Labour
chair of a parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said bluntly: “That’s not
going to happen.” She said the only way it could happen would be if Israel
changed its government before September.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But even in the extremely unlikely event that Benjamin
Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, agreed with Starmer’s “conditions,” that
would still create a pathway for Britain recognising Palestine as part of a
two-state solution.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Starmer has been advised throughout by Jonathan Powell, his
national security adviser, who has stressed the importance of holding back
recognition until it might make some difference. He notes more than 140 nations
have recognised a Palestinian state to little effect.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Powell, an architect of the Northern Ireland peace process,
wanted Britain to act with other allies, but Macron’s surprise decision to
announce the French position last week left Starmer looking like he was being
buffeted by events.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Starmer has been suspected by some inside the Labour party
of being too soft on Netanyahu ever since a radio interview in October 2023,
when he was asked whether Israel’s right to self-defence extended to cutting
off power and water to Gaza. “I think that Israel does have that right,”
Starmer replied. He later claimed he was answering a previous question and was
not backing the cutting off of crucial supplies to Gaza, but the perception
stuck.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ministers and Labour MPs have been frustrated with Starmer.
After Macron announced his stance on statehood, one minister said: “The block
is Keir himself as well as his senior advisers and their desire to stay close
to the US.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Downing Street officials admitted the US might react
negatively to Starmer’s ultimatum to Netanyahu. Marco Rubio, US secretary of
state, said last week that Macron’s move was “a reckless decision that only
serves Hamas propaganda.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">US President Donald Trump was less hostile to the idea
during his meetings with Starmer in Scotland this week, suggesting he would not
be too upset if the UK went down the same route as France. Trump’s comments on
scenes of “real starvation” in Gaza also changed the mood. But the US president
is wary of the UK plan, while Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz is unlikely
to back a Palestinian state any time soon.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nor is there any sign Netanyahu will change his approach to
Gaza and endorse a peace process based on a two-state solution for fear of
Britain and France formally recognising a Palestinian state in September.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But Starmer’s plan was backed by the British public in a
poll by YouGov released on Tuesday, which showed 45 per cent of people
supported recognition of a Palestinian state, with only 14 per cent opposed.
Starmer, who is also trying to galvanise an international aid effort, has
belatedly aligned himself with his party and the public on Palestinian
statehood. Many Labour figures wish it had just happened sooner.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
