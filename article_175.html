rose more than expected in the three months to June. The American economy grew
at an annualised rate of 3 per cent, beating Wall Street’s expectations and
contrasting with a 0.5 per cent contraction in the first quarter.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However, analysts noted that the headline figure masked a
significant slowdown on an annual basis and was primarily driven by a fall in
imports by companies that had previously been stockpiling in anticipation of US
tariffs on imported goods.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US Dollar index, which measures the strength of the
currency against a basket of peers, was 0.6 per cent higher by the early
afternoon in New York. The move puts the dollar on track for its biggest gains
since October — before the election of President Donald Trump.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The currency is still down more than 8 per cent this year,
having tumbled as Trump’s volatile trade policies and his criticism of the US
Federal Reserve shook investor faith in American assets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">US government bond yields rose on signs of continued
economic strength. Those on benchmark 10-year Treasuries gained 4 basis points
to 4.37 per cent as investors sold the debt. Immediately after the data
release, yields on two-year US debt, which tend to track interest rate
expectations, rose 3bp.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Wall Street stocks also rose with the blue-chip S&amp;P 500
index moving 0.2 per cent higher and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining
0.3 per cent. US stocks continue to hover near record highs, having roared back
from a rout in April when Trump first announced his “reciprocal” tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The euro fell for the fifth consecutive session, losing 0.7
per cent of its dollar value to trade at $1.1470. The single currency has
fallen 2.3 per cent so far this week, leaving it on track for its worst week
since September 2022.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 index closed flat,
Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax rose 0.2 per cent while in Paris the Cac 40 edged 0.1 per
cent higher. London’s FTSE 100 was flat.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sterling fell 0.6 per cent against the strengthening dollar
while the yen retreated 0.4 per cent.</p></body></html>
