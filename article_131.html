billionaire</h2><p class="MsoNormal">The enthusiasm expressed by billionaires for the book <i>The
Sovereign Individual</i>, so ably dissected by Elaine Moore in her column “The
book that explains the billionaire doomers” (Opinion, July 25) demonstrates a
significant reversal in the arc of history.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The political economy of the likes of Adam Smith and David
Ricardo was founded on the critical distinction between wealth, as consumable
items of production, and the money claims erected on that basis.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As a side order, natural moral competence would come to the
fore, making redundant the need for control by elites.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Modern market thinking claims descent from Smith but is
anything but.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Now markets are understood as a (desirable) means of freeing
money claims from the needs of ordinary life.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Individual sovereignty means scooping the rental benefits of
network monopolies, and escaping the restrictions that prioritise
environmental, public safety or public health concerns.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In this ill-thought-out “political exit” these billionaires
are on course to bring an end to sustainable capitalist development, and in its
stead a return to a world of Old Corruption now re-presented as the brave new
world of tech, but still just that old story of money.</p><p class="MsoNormal">William Dixon<br/>
