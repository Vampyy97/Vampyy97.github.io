Akila Quinio — New York</p><p class="MsoNormal">Revolut is weighing buying a US lender in an effort to get
an American banking licence rapidly, as the UK’s biggest fintech continues its
push to clinch a similar accreditation in its home country.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The fintech was considering acquiring a nationally chartered
bank in a move that would allow it to lend in the US, two people familiar with
the matter told the Financial Times.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The people said an acquisition would allow Revolut to expand
in the US more quickly than if it were to apply for a banking charter by
itself, and that it would potentially target a cheap bank that already holds a
national licence.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Revolut has made no firm decision on buying a US bank, and
was also considering applying for a banking licence in its own right, said
another person familiar with the matter.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deregulatory agenda of US President Donald Trump had
created a perception that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the
regulator, would speed up the process for awarding bank charters, the person
added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Revolut, which has 60 million customers globally, is
discussing a $1bn deal that would include raising funds and give it a valuation
of about $65bn, the FT reported this month. Part of that funding would help
finance its global expansion. The fintech, founded in 2015, snapped up
Argentine bank Cetelem from BNP Paribas last month.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Revolut declined to comment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Revolut has licences in Lithuania, allowing it to trade as a
bank across the EU, and Mexico. But it is yet to gain authorisation to operate
as a fully fledged bank in the UK. After a three-year process, its application
for a banking licence was approved last year, with restrictions until it met
regulators’ conditions. But, 12 months later, Revolut still faces restrictions
on UK lending.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Revolut’s banking division has been allowed to accept
deposits of only £50,000 while the company builds its IT infrastructure, risk
controls, compliance functions and other systems.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Chancellor Rachel Reeves tried to set up a meeting between
the Treasury, the... PRA and Revolut to discuss the licence before the idea was
rebuffed by BoE governor Andrew Bailey amid concerns the bank’s regulation
should be independent, the FT reported this week.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">An investor who was also stopped at the airport said his
heart began to pound. "I desperately searched my memory for anything I
could possibly have done wrong," he said. "I was consumed with dread.
Each day felt like a year."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Both individuals, who asked not to be named, said it took
months to lift the bans, which were related to cases in which they were
tangentially involved.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The investor said his case stemmed from a financial dispute
at a Chinese company of which he was a director.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nearly all of the 53,000 court-ordered exit bans issued last
year involved civil cases, the data from China's supreme court showed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the recent case of the US banker, China's finance
ministry said Chenyue Mao, a top trade finance banker at Wells Fargo, was
"involved in a criminal case", without elaborating.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Wells Fargo's China operations are limited, but Mao, a US
citizen based in Atlanta, had over a decade-long career; she helped build up
the group's international factoring business, a service that allows domestic
exporters to sell overseas account receivables at a slight discount for
immediate cash.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Several import-export company executives said her team was
well-known in China. "Wells Fargo helps Chinese companies going global
with things like factoring and supply chain financing - they're pretty strong
in this area," said one Chinese partner of the bank.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Mao was elected chair of FCI, a factoring and trade finance
association, at the end of June.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Mao did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Wells
Fargo halted all work travel to China.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The reasons for the exit ban on the US government employee,
who was visiting relatives in China, are also unclear.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Authorities have declined to disclose any information about
the case. The New York Times reported the employee had been unable to leave the
country since mid-April, and had been interrogated by China's security
services.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US embassy said they were "tracking this case very
closely and are engaged with Chinese officials to resolve the situation as
quickly as possible".</p><p class="MsoNormal">Experts and affected individuals said exit bans were being
applied by a broader set of Chinese authorities. In some cases, cash-strapped
local governments have detained and fined business executives, a practice known
as "long-range fishing".</p><p class="MsoNormal">Safeguard Defenders, a China-focused human rights
non-profit, said in a report that the arsenal of Chinese laws authorising exit
bans had expanded from 10 to 14 between 2018 and 2022. These include the
Supervision Law, which was amended in 2018 to permit an exit ban to be imposed
on anyone under investigation or those connected to an investigation, even if
they were not a suspect.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The investor who had been subject to an exit ban said that
the arbitrary use of such tools had damaged business confidence in China, at a
time when policymakers are trying to boost lagging economic growth. "The
core issue is abuse of power, which creates a pervasive sense of fear," he
said. "Exit bans undermine the government's own message of welcoming
foreign investors and capital. Until the issue of fear is resolved,
entrepreneurs won't dare to act."</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
