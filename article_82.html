unusually low: it can be considered a success that the alliance survived the
summit intact.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As expected, the main result was the European pledge to
spend 3.5 per cent on defence and 1.5 per cent on defence-relevant
infrastructure by 2035, bringing the total spending by European countries to 5
per cent of GDP — the number Donald Trump had demanded some months earlier. The
spending pledge seems to have pacified the US president for now.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But while no one disputes that Europe needs to do more, the
focus on how much is spent instead of what it is spent on is harmful. It
distracts from what Europe should really be focusing on: capability development
and interoperability. Indeed, making Europeans commit to an arbitrary defence
spending target is the best way to keep Europe from reaching strategic
autonomy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">First, given the vastly different sizes of European
economies, spending 5 per cent of GDP on defence is going to mean vastly
different results in terms of the combat effectiveness it produces. For
comparison, Germany's GDP is €4.3tn, meaning a defence budget of more than
€200bn at 5 per cent spending. Estonia’s GDP is a little less than €40bn,
meaning 5 per cent amounts to just under €2bn. The situation looks similar for
the other two Baltic states, Latvia and Lithuania, which are most at risk if
Russia expands its war into Nato territory.</p><p class="MsoNormal">So the defence spending will be not only unequally, but
counter-intuitively, distributed. European Nato allies' capabilities are built
where they are most urgently needed. A contribution to Baltic air defence could
be considered as part of the German presence in Lithuania.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Second, it is not smart to spend a lot if you can spend
less. Trying to meet a goal sum rather than capability targets creates
incentives to pay a lot instead of focusing on outcomes. Ukraine, for example,
has learnt to produce equipment cheaply and at large scale. National defence
spending targets do not encourage better co-ordination and co-operation in the
EU, which is crucial in a highly fragmented and inefficient defence industrial
base. Efforts to co-ordinate demand and supply for more coherent procurement
and production are therefore more important than any spending target.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A high spending goal does not automatically encourage
cost-effective arrangements such as the reserve-based conscription armies
common in the Nordic-Baltic region. Unlike professional forces, reservists are
not missing from the regular workforce and pensions do not eat up a large share
of the defence budget. In Belgium, Bulgaria and Italy, nearly 20 per cent of
defence budgets go on pension payments.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There has been some progress. The European Investment Bank’s
recent rule change to allow it to lend or invest indirectly in companies. This
would give the industry space to succeed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Third, such a spending target will inevitably lead to
creative accounting. Italy has already said it will start counting pensions as
part of its defence budget. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has
suggested counting climate action as defence spending. Nato allies are,
fortunately, allowed to count their military support for Ukraine towards the 5
per cent, which creates an incentive to maintain that. But the spending target
applies only to European allies; the US is not incentivised to resume its military
aid to Kyiv.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Finally, rather than pumping in more state funding to the
European defence industry through rigid and slow public procurement procedures,
it would be better to streamline regulation of defence industrial markets and
encourage more private investment — as with the European Investment Bank’s
recent rule change to allow it to lend or invest indirectly in companies. This
would give the industry space to succeed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The writer is a fellow at CEPA Transatlantic Defense and
