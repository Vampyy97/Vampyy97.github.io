undermine the European Central Bank’s control over monetary policy, a senior
official from the central bank has warned.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Jurgen Schaaf, an adviser in the ECB’s market infrastructure
and payments unit, warned that the rapid adoption of stablecoins could leave
the Eurozone facing similar conditions to “dollarised” emerging economies,
where widespread use of the US currency can hamper local policymakers' efforts
to set interest rates or control the money supply.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Global circulation of stablecoins — tokens that track the
value of fiat currencies and are a cornerstone of crypto trading — has risen to
about $250bn. The vast majority are linked to the dollar as President Donald
Trump pushes to establish them as a pillar of mainstream finance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Should US dollar stablecoins become widely used in the euro
area — whether for payments, savings or settlement — the ECB’s control over
monetary conditions could be weakened,” wrote Schaaf in an article published on
the ECB’s blog yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">He added that a “disorderly collapse” of private sector
stablecoins could “reverberate across the financial system” with central banks
being increasingly concerned about contagion.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Tether and Circle operate the two largest stablecoins but
the passage this month of landmark US legislation to regulate the sector is
expected to pave the way for Wall Street banks to launch their own offerings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Stablecoins are backed one-for-one by safe assets such as
government bonds and are designed to act as a bridge between cryptocurrencies
and the mainstream financial system.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Their backers argue that they are more efficient than
international bank transfers but their anonymity has made them popular conduits
for drug trafficking and money laundering.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The ECB’s warning marks the latest concern among central
bankers over the growth of stablecoins.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Bank for International Settlements said last month that
stablecoins “perform badly” as money because they are not backed by central
banks, lack sufficient guardrails against illicit usage and do not have the
flexibility of funding needed to generate loans.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump’s drive to promote stablecoins would underpin the
greenback’s global dominance and could lower US borrowing costs, according to
Schaaf.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“For Europe, this would mean higher financing costs relative
to the United States, reduced monetary policy autonomy and geopolitical
dependency,” he wrote.</p></body></html>
