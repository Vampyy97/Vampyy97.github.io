its move to a US listing this week, but the proxy advisers that supported it
could end up as losers. A fight over the terms of the move should have been a
chance for the under-fire advisers to show their worth, but instead they
managed to miss key details or fuel confusion with mixed messages.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Shortcomings among firms that advise shareholders on how to
vote should worry investors more broadly. At issue was Wise’s attempt to bundle
its plan to move with a decade-long extension of its dual-class shareholder
structure. Taavet Hinrikus, Wise’s co-founder and third-largest investor, said
Wise had not been upfront about its plans and was betraying its commitment to
“radical transparency.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">In theory, ISS and Glass Lewis, the largest proxy advisers,
don’t approve of dual-class shares. However, their reports — which recommended
that investors support Wise’s relisting — failed to point out the proposed
extension until Skaala highlighted it. They updated their reports noting
governance concerns. They didn't change their recommendations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Pirc, a smaller proxy adviser, did notice the governance
issues and advised investors to vote against Wise’s proposals. But not before
Pirc had shown Wise an earlier version of its report that supported it. Wise
cited the endorsement and said that it had not realised that Pirc had ended up
publishing a different recommendation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Admittedly, Wise didn’t make it easy for ISS and Glass
Lewis. The detailed proposals said its new holding company would have a
dual-class structure “substantially similar” to the current arrangement. The
fact that the current arrangement was set to expire next year — rather than
next decade — was mentioned in a single bullet point halfway through the
98-page circular.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But being an expert on these sorts of issues is precisely
what investors are paying proxies for. In the words of the Council of
Institutional Investors, proxy advisers “serve as collective research
providers” for those who lack the resources and time to stay on top of hundreds
of companies in a diversified portfolio.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Highlighting the concerns earlier probably wouldn't have
changed the result of Wise’s vote. Even an unfavourable recommendation might
not have. Research commissioned by the UK’s Financial Reporting Council has
found that their reports are influential, but not as all-powerful as critics
make out. Still, drawing attention earlier would at least have encouraged a
more open discussion.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Proxy advisers are used to criticism from politicians and
executives such as Jamie Dimon and Elon Musk. In contrast, only 6 per cent of
investors surveyed in the FRC report said they were dissatisfied with the
service they receive.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The mis-steps over Wise weaken the argument, usually put
forward by the companies, that proxy advisers are overly powerful attack dogs —
but not for the right reasons. Investors should be as willing to question them
as companies are.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
