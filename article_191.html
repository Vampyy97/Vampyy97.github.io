situation</h2><p class="MsoNormal">by Joel Suss</p><p class="MsoNormal">No industry symbolises Canada more than maple syrup. The
dark, sweet sap, vacuum‑pumped from maple trees during the cold winter
months, is so important to the country that it maintains a national stockpile.
Just as Japan has a strategic reserve of rice, so Canada has one for syrup.
After a stretch of bad harvests, last year’s production set a new record. This
year could beat it. At a rustic, wood‑built cabane à sucre (sugar shack)
outside Montreal, there was still snow in the air and no sign of buds on trees
by mid‑April — an indication it would be a particularly long maple
season. There was plenty of syrup to pour over our pork‑heavy lunch — a
Québécois tradition.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But Canada’s syrup industry is now facing another disruption
south of the border. US tariffs, which Trump has threatened to set at 35 per
cent for some products from August 1, would be extremely costly for the
country’s producers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The tariffs threaten to change an industry that has existed
for more than a century. Tapping maple trees is a practice that long predates
European settlement of North America. The native technique to extract sap —
which was used to cook in place of water and to season instead of salt —
involved making a V‑shaped incision on the bark and placing reeds to run
the sap into a pot to be evaporated into concentrated sugars.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Typically extracted from a few species of trees — notably
the sugar and red maple varieties, which take some 40 years to grow to maturity
— production requires cold winters and springs with freezing nights and above‑freezing
days, confining the harvest window to a few short weeks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The forest territory straddles the US‑Canada border,
with most of the production centred on Quebec, Vermont and New York.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This is why Canada dominates global maple syrup production,
accounting for approximately 73 per cent of output last year. US demand is so
voracious that it can only be satiated with large volumes of Canadian imports.
Despite US domestic production quadrupling over the past two decades, the
country’s taps cannot keep up. Over 45mn kilogrammes of Canadian maple syrup —
enough to smother 3bn American pancakes — went across the border in 2024,
amounting to almost 60 per cent of the country’s total demand.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The syrup is therefore a good representation of both
Canada’s economic dependence on its southern neighbour — and its unique forms
of leverage.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For years, syrup flowed freely across the border. But in
1909 US tariffs were imposed to protect American production. In 1972, when
those tariffs were cut back to zero, the US Department of Agriculture released
a research report which found that the maple tariff was “never very effective
in protecting the domestic maple industry from foreign competition”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">After this, Canada made its own efforts to protect the
industry. In 1996, a maple syrup federation was created in Quebec — where 90
per cent of its syrup comes from. The cartel (known formally as the Quebec
Maple Syrup Producers) sets a floor on global syrup prices and smooths out
variable harvests.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Once processed, Canadian maple syrup can sit in the
federation’s enormous warehouses — which have 53 Olympic swimming pools’ worth
of storage capacity — for years without degrading.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The federation says that any unsold inventory can be added
to this strategic reserve. It also points out that it has made strides
diversifying away from US buyers in recent years, reducing the proportion of
production that goes there by roughly 20 percentage points over the last couple
of decades.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Still, tariffs would cause widescale disruption on both
sides of the border. Canadian prime minister Mark Carney has pointed to other
points of resistance the country can wield, notably trade in potash, crude oil
and hydroelectric power. “Canada has what the world needs,” he declared after
his election victory.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump’s message on the domestic impact of US tariffs has
been to tell American children that they can make do with less dolls. He may
next try telling them to eat less pancakes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">joel.suss@ft.com</p></body></html>
