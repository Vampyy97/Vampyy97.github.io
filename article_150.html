agency will face more political pressure and smear campaigns, despite President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s U-turn on the office’s independence after rare wartime
protests and a backlash from Western allies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Oleksandr Klymenko, head of Ukraine’s Specialised
Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sapo), in an interview with the Financial
Times, described recent moves against his agency as part of a “co-ordinated”
effort by senior government officials. The pressure culminated in Zelenskyy
signing a law last week that placed Sapo and its law enforcement counterpart,
the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu), under executive control.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Klymenko said the campaign was aimed at undermining the
independence of Ukraine’s anti-corruption bodies, gaining access to case files
and exerting influence over investigations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Even if parliament overturns the controversial law that MPs
rammed through last week — a vote on a new bill restoring both Sapo and Nabu’s
independence and endorsed by Zelenskyy is set for today — Klymenko made clear
that serious damage had been done. He warned that the “lasting” consequences of
the assault could limit his office’s ability to function. “Our work has been
effectively stopped,” he said. “Almost all of our whistleblowers stopped
cooperating with us” over fears that they could be exposed, he added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While Klymenko declined to name those he believes
responsible, he said the country’s highest echelons of power were deeply
involved in the undermining of Ukraine’s anti-corruption drive.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The agencies are at the centre of the most serious political
crisis of Zelenskyy’s wartime presidency — one largely of his own making —
after his move to bring them under executive control ignited allegations of an
authoritarian power grab, triggered protests and caused alarm among Ukraine's
allies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Zelenskyy has conceded that “probably, there should have
been a dialogue” with Ukrainian society and partners ahead of his move against
Nabu and Sapo, and pledged to remedy their concerns in the new bill.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The outcome of today’s vote is uncertain, with upwards of 70
MPs from Zelenskyy’s party fearing retribution. If the bill passes, Klymenko
called for it to come into force as soon as tomorrow.</p><p class="MsoNormal">According to four people close to Zelenskyy and familiar
with internal party talks, some MPs are scared they would be pursued by Sapo
and Nabu after they voted in favour of moving the agencies under control of the
prosecutor-general, who is appointed by the president.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Klymenko previously defended his agency's investigations,
saying it had “never engaged in political persecution” and that they were
“based totally on facts and evidence, not on political positions or the votes
of members of parliament.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday, Klymenko said that Nabu and Sapo were
investigating corruption allegations into 31 sitting and 40 former MPs,
including several from Zelenskyy’s party. The agencies have also brought
corruption charges against senior officials, including deputy prime minister
Oleksiy Chernyshov, who was charged with abuse of power and illegal enrichment
last month. Chernyshov, who denies the allegations, was dismissed in this
month’s cabinet reshuffle.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Zelenskyy had claimed his move to bring Nabu and Sapo under
his control was necessary to “clear” them of Russian infiltration. Klymenko
acknowledged that Moscow may have tried to subvert the agencies, but said there
was “insufficient evidence” to back this up.</p></body></html>
