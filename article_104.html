who it says were responsible for a deadly attack in Kashmir in April that
brought New Delhi and Islamabad to the brink of war.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Amit Shah, India's home minister and a close ally of Prime
Minister Narendra Modi, told parliament yesterday that security forces had
killed "all three terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack" in
Indian-controlled Kashmir on Monday, following a months-long operation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">All three were members of the Pakistan-based terror group
Lashkar-e-Taiba, Shah said, without providing further evidence.</p><p class="MsoNormal">On April 22, at least three militants opened fire in a
meadow popular with tourists in Pahalgam, killing 26 people, most of them
Hindus. It was the country's deadliest terror attack on civilians since the
2008 Mumbai attacks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">New Delhi blamed Islamabad, which denied any role in the
incident and called for a "neutral" investigation, and launched its
deepest military strikes on Pakistan for almost five decades.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Over the next four days, the two nuclear-armed neighbours
exchanged air strikes, missiles and drone attacks that threatened to spiral
into a full-blown war, raising concerns around the world.</p><p class="MsoNormal">India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in May, for which
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed credit. New Delhi insists the
ceasefire came after Pakistan's military contacted its Indian counterpart to
request a mutual end to the strikes. New Delhi has also been rankled by Trump's
offer to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, a contested territory
parts of which each side controls. India wants any negotiations over the
territory to be bilateral, while Pakistan has welcomed international mediation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Rajnath Singh, India's defence minister, said on Monday that
New Delhi had halted its operation in May because it had achieved all of its
"political and military objectives", dismissing any suggestion that
it had been pushed to do so.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But Modi's government has been under pressure from the
opposition in recent weeks to show tangible gains from its investigation into
the attack.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Shah said yesterday that Modi had "ensured that the
masterminds of the Pahalgam attack were eliminated" in its attacks on
Pakistan, while the "three Pakistani terrorists [were] eliminated" on
Monday. Shah said the identities of the suspects were confirmed by four
witnesses who had previously helped them. Their rifles were matched to shells
recovered from Pahalgam through ballistic tests, he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Local police had initially identified two Pakistani
nationals and one Indian as suspects in the attack.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Shah said Indian forces had identified Pakistani voter
numbers for two of the suspects. He added "Pakistani-made chocolates"
were recovered from them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Pakistan's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for
comment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">India and Pakistan have fought multiple wars over
Muslim-majority Kashmir since 1947.</p><p class="MsoNormal">India has long accused Pakistan of supporting separatist
groups in the territory. Pakistan denies backing terrorism and says it has
provided only moral and diplomatic support for the cause of self-determination
in Kashmir.</p></body></html>
