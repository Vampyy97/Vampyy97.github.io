start-up at $170bn<br/>
By Ivan Levingston — Montreal<br/>
George Hammond — San Francisco</p><p class="MsoNormal">Iconiq Capital is set to lead a $5bn funding round for
artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic that would value the company at
$170bn, almost triple the valuation it achieved four months ago.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The investment group has submitted its proposed terms to
Anthropic, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter, in a
deal that would make the four-year-old start-up one of the most valuable
private technology companies in the world.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Iconiq is a San Francisco-based investment group that
manages the wealth of high-profile tech billionaires including Facebook
co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz, LinkedIn co-founder Reid
Hoffman and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The group began as a wealth adviser to the super-rich in
2011 and now manages more than $80bn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Anthropic has been in talks with multiple investors,
including the United Arab Emirates state investment fund MGX and existing
partner Amazon, about fresh investment in recent weeks, the Financial Times has
reported.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The start-up closed a $3.5bn funding round that priced it at
$61.5bn in March. Anthropic’s annual recurring revenue has quadrupled to about
$4bn over the course of this year and the group is capitalising on intense
investor interest in fast-growing AI start-ups.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal comes amid a battle for funding, with AI groups
looking beyond Silicon Valley to sovereign wealth funds.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A valuation of $170bn would make Anthropic one of the most
valuable private tech companies, behind rival OpenAI, which is valued at
$300bn, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX at $400bn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">AI start-ups and Big Tech groups are engaged in aggressive
competition to develop cutting-edge tools and sell them to individuals and
businesses, a move that requires huge investment to power and train large
language models.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Anthropic was founded in 2021 by senior staff at OpenAI, who
left after clashing with co-founder Sam Altman over the company’s direction.
One of the breakaway group's earliest backers was Moskovitz, an Iconiq client.
Zuckerberg, also a major Iconiq client, is reportedly positioning Meta to
better compete with AI rivals such as Anthropic and OpenAI.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Anthropic has touted its commitment to developing AI tools
safely, responsibly and ethically and has previously resisted raising money
directly from the Middle East. But last week Anthropic chief executive Dario
Amodei wrote to staff to tell them the company was changing its Middle East
stance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While Amodei warned that the move could “enrich dictators”,
he added: “Unfortunately, I think ‘no bad person should ever benefit from our
success’ is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Iconiq and Anthropic declined to comment.</p></body></html>
