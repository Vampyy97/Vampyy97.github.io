KATHRIN HILLE — TAIPEI</p><p class="MsoNormal">Donald Trump has denied permission for Taiwan’s President
Lai Ching-te to stop in New York en route to Central America, after China
raised objections with Washington about the visit.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lai planned to transit the US in August en route to
Paraguay, Guatemala and Belize, which recognise Taiwan as a country. But the US
told Lai he could not visit New York on the way, according to three people
familiar with the decision.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Late on Monday, Lai’s office issued a statement saying he
had no plans to travel overseas in the near future because Taiwan was
recovering from a recent typhoon and Taipei was in talks with the US on
tariffs. The people familiar with the matter said his decision not to travel
came after he had been told he would not be allowed to visit New York.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The decision will deepen concerns among Taiwan's supporters
in Washington that Trump is taking a softer stance on China as he pushes for a
summit with President Xi Jinping. China objects to Taiwanese leaders visiting
the US, which does not have diplomatic relations with Taipei.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In 2023, Joe Biden allowed then-president Tsai Ing-wen to
stop in New York on her way to Belize and Guatemala.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lai had approached the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think-tank in Washington, to host him at an event in New York during his
proposed trip, according to a person familiar with the matter. Lai also planned
to visit Dallas.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It was unclear if the US had denied permission to visit New
York only or whether he was told he could not transit through the country at
all. A senior US official said both sides were “working to remedy the
situation” and that no trip had been cancelled.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Bonnie Glaser, a China and Taiwan expert at the German
Marshall Fund think-tank, said the decision suggested “Trump wants to avoid
irritating Beijing while US-China negotiations are ongoing and planning gets
under way for a possible summit with Xi Jinping.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Trump should be standing up to People’s Republic of China
pressure, not caving into it,” Glaser said. “By signalling that aspects of the
US relationship with Taiwan are negotiable, Trump will weaken deterrence and
embolden Xi to press for additional concessions regarding Taiwan.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Several people familiar with the debate said the Trump
administration was trying to avoid jeopardising trade talks with China.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng started a
third round of negotiations in Stockholm on Monday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Trump administration has also held back taking tough
actions against China after Beijing in May slowed the export of rare earths to
the US, using its dominance in the industry as leverage against Washington.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Randy Shriver, a former senior US official and now chair of
the Institute for Indo-Pacific Security, said of the block on Lai: “If this is
a result of the administration trying to curry favour with Beijing, it is a
mistake. This is the old playbook, ‘tyranny of the calendar,’ where there is
never a good time to do something on Taiwan. You box yourself in.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Rush Doshi, a former National Security Council China
official, said the Lai move was part of an across-the-board softening of policy
towards China ahead of a possible summit with Xi. “What will they do when
Beijing pockets [the concessions] and asks for more, like changing Taiwan
policy or demanding even better US technology?” said Doshi, a senior fellow at
the Council on Foreign Relations.</p></body></html>
