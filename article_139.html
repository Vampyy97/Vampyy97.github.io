region</h2><p class="MsoNormal">SOPHAL EAR</p><p class="MsoNormal">When border disputes turn deadly, it is rarely only about
lines on a map. The recent military escalation between Thailand and Cambodia —
fuelled by rocket attacks, fighter jet retaliation and civilian casualties —
has taken a more than century-old historical disagreement into uncharted and
dangerous territory. Behind the chaos lie two combustible forces: domestic
political instability and regional diplomatic dysfunction.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Two political dynasties sit at the heart of the conflict:
the Hun family in Cambodia and the Shinawatra family in Thailand. In Phnom
Penh, the decision of Hun Sen, Cambodia’s former prime minister and now Senate
president, to leak a private conversation with Thailand’s then-prime minister
Paetongtarn Shinawatra was reckless. It undermined regional trust, humiliated a
neighbouring leader and ignited nationalist backlash that Thai hardliners were
all too ready to exploit.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In Bangkok, the consequences were swift. Thailand’s
military, already uncomfortable with Paetongtarn’s leadership and her family’s
political legacy, seized on the incident to assert dominance. The leak provided
a convenient casus belli. The resulting clashes were not just about
sovereignty, but about power, pride and internal power struggles. Cambodia's
decision to pursue confrontation, despite its limited military capability,
suggests that Hun Sen’s motivations were as much about consolidating domestic
political control as national defence or territorial integrity.</p><p class="MsoNormal">What followed was predictable yet perilous: escalation,
civilian deaths and the collapse of border diplomacy. With dozens dead and
hundreds of thousands displaced, the region teetered on the edge of wider war.
Hospitals and gas stations were struck. Temples near the front lines were
turned into militarised zones and damaged. Civilians, caught in the crossfire,
paid the highest price.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This is not simply a bilateral failure — it is a systemic
one. ASEAN, the regional bloc charged with maintaining peace among its members,
was slow to act. It took Malaysia’s prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who
currently holds the ASEAN chair, to finally bring both sides to the table.
China, the dominant external economic force in both countries, avoided taking
sides, more invested in avoiding regional instability than in offering public
leadership.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It was the US that eventually stepped in with the bluntest
of instruments: tariff threats. These economic pressures, more than diplomatic
finesse, appear to have moved both parties to accept a temporary ceasefire.
Donald Trump’s personal diplomacy, though unconventional, appears to have
produced a pause in the fighting — but one held together more by threat than
trust.</p><p class="MsoNormal">That ceasefire is welcome. But it is fragile. Cambodia and
Thailand are scheduled to resume talks in early August. Whether those
negotiations produce durable agreements remains uncertain. The structural
drivers of this conflict — elite power struggles, unresolved territorial claims
and hyper-nationalist politics — have not gone away. If anything, they have
been reinforced by recent events.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The international community, and especially ASEAN, must
treat this crisis as a warning. This is what happens when diplomacy erodes and
nationalist politics fill the void. Cambodia's leadership, eager to ride a wave
of patriotic fervour, risks undermining its own long-term security and
international reputation. Thailand’s military, emboldened by domestic political
uncertainty, may find that tactical victories come at the expense of regional
stability and civilian lives.</p><p class="MsoNormal">If ASEAN wants to remain relevant, it must act decisively.
That means not only de-escalating this crisis, but also creating permanent
mechanisms to resolve long-simmering disputes. The bloc should begin by
strengthening early warning systems and confidence-building measures between
border forces. China, too, must take a more active role. Its neutrality is
understandable, but no longer tenable if it wants to be seen as a responsible
regional stakeholder. And the US must go beyond tariffs. If Washington seeks
credibility as a Pacific power, it has to support regional diplomacy, not just
wield economic sticks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This conflict did not need to happen. And it must not be
allowed to happen again. As the saying goes, “Borders frequented by trade and
diplomacy seldom need soldiers.” Cambodia and Thailand have long traded,
co-operated and intertwined socially and culturally. It is now time to rebuild
that peace, before another misstep turns ceasefire into war.</p></body></html>
