ratings have dropped to second-term lows yet the Democratic party’s have fallen
even further. They ought to be soaring. Just a third of Americans approve of
them. Much the same can be said of centrist and centre-left parties across the
west. The odd one out is Canada. That is because Mark Carney’s Liberal party is
the staunchest defender of Canada’s sovereignty — the opposition having been
too cosy with Trump. But Canada is the exception that proves the rule. Western
liberalism is still on the retreat.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Where liberal democratic parties are in power, normal
hydraulics still work. A year after taking office, Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour is
lucky to poll at 25 per cent. Nigel Farage’s seven-year-old populist Reform
party is meanwhile attracting almost a third of voters. Less than three months
after taking office, Germany's two big parties are neck and neck with far right
Alternative for Germany. This is in spite (or maybe because) of the fact that
German intelligence recently branded AfD as rightwing extremist.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In France, Marine Le Pen’s far right Rassemblement National
likewise polls streets ahead of the other parties in spite of Le Pen having
been debarred from running in the next presidential election.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Of the major European nations, Italy’s hard right Giorgia
Meloni has the highest approval rating. Even Trump, who is sinking into a
self-created doldrum, has his head above water. His recent 37 per cent Gallup
rating is well above the Democratic party. When the left is in office,
populists make hay. When the right holds power, the left rarely do. For further
evidence, see Benjamin Netanyahu's Israel and Narendra Modi’s India.</p><p class="MsoNormal">That there are multiple causes of western liberalism’s
malaise makes it harder to fix. Complexity encourages infighting. Long after
Taylor Swift hits retirement age, Democrats will still be arguing over whether
Joe Biden was too old to run, or too selfish to step down sooner. They might
also still be debating whether the left is too woke or not woke enough. Can the
left in office do more to improve the economy for the blue-collar classes? Does
immigration enrich society or further squeeze the working class? Should there
be a wealth tax? Is Israel committing war crimes? Such questions reliably
divide.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Beyond the internal divisions, contemporary liberalism has
two character defects that augur badly for its resurgence. The first is lack of
conviction. It is all very well pointing out the dangers of Trump, Farage, Le
Pen and others. It would be negligent not to. But making the negative case is
not enough. “I might not be beautiful but have you seen that ugly person next
to me?” said no winner of a beauty contest ever. “Stronger together”, “When we
fight, we win” or campaign variations thereof do not mask the uncertainty
beneath. As Bill Clinton once said, strong and wrong always beats weak and
right. Focus groups cannot solve this.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Western liberalism’s second defect is intolerance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">American liberals were at their worst during the pandemic.
That anti-vaxxer conservatives were even crazier should be no comfort. One day,
it seemed, Dr Anthony Fauci was telling America that masks were not essential.
The next, Rochelle Walensky, then head of the Centers for Disease Control was
insisting that two-year-olds should be masked all day. Anyone entertaining the
theory that the virus might have come from a Wuhan lab was dismissed as
Sinophobic or worse. In December 2020, when vaccines became available, the
Chicago Teachers Union tweeted, “The push to reopen schools is rooted in
sexism, racism, and misogyny.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Everyone could agree back then that otherwise liberal Sweden
was foolish to take the herd immunity route. That Sweden ended up with one of
the lowest mortality rates in Europe has not been similarly highlighted. Covid
is not ancient history. Any survey probing why so many young voters are turning
right that excludes their pandemic experience is wasting time. The road to
recovery starts with looking in the mirror. The seminal book, <i>In Covid’s
Wake: How Our Politics Failed Us</i>, by two Princeton scholars should be
compulsory reading across the spectrum. That it has not been reviewed by most
major newspapers is troubling.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As go social distancing rules, so goes free speech.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Liberals said, “Follow the science”, which confused science
with faith. Science is a trial and error process that only works with openness
to dissent. The same applies to political debate on campus, within newspapers,
at think-tanks and society at large. To many younger voters, particularly men,
today’s liberal establishment looks more like a conservative one. Educated
elites confect orthodoxy on what we should say and do. The resemblance to high
Victorianism is more than passing. Victorians regulated manners and etiquette.
They also dreaded the mob. Expanding religions look for converts. Waning ones
hunt down heretics. In form and content, western liberalism is dangerously
close to the latter.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The good news is that liberalism has rebounded before after
losing self-belief. The bad news is that it took a genocidal second world war
to rediscover its necessity. Hoping that humanity is on a learning curve is not
a strategy. The positive case for liberal democracy in today’s world is still
waiting to be heard.</p><p class="MsoNormal">edward.luce@ft.com</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
