BoCom move</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="483" id="Picture 1" src="FT_files/image095.png" width="370"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">HSBC has long argued that its shareholding in China’s Bank
of Communications is critical to its strategy and symbolic of its strong ties
to the country. Perhaps, though, those ties aren’t as strong as it thought.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Chinese government recently elbowed HSBC aside in a
$17bn capital raise. Awkward as that looks for the Hong Kong lender, Beijing
might have actually done HSBC a favour. HSBC’s BoCom holding is down from 19
per cent to 16 per cent, it confirmed yesterday, as it reported a $2.1bn charge
from writing down the value of its stake. China’s move was part of a broader
injection of some $70bn across four of the country’s bigger banks to boost
their lending ability.</p><p class="MsoNormal">HSBC does not appear to have been asked to follow the money.
Should it have been, BoCom’s second-largest backer would most likely have
balked — or its own investors would have — but it’s hard to avoid the sense of
a slight when the result is the biggest change in HSBC’s holding since it first
took a stake in 2004.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There are aeons of China banking history between now and
then, when the country’s thinly capitalised banks were eager for westerners’
cash and their knowhow. HSBC’s $1.75bn agreement to buy 19.9 per cent of BoCom
was signed in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, no
less, and included promises to send executives. It spurred a rush of similar
deals, often for bigger amounts though smaller stakes, by competitors. Since
then, HSBC’s rivals have mostly exited their holdings following the 2008
financial crisis, either to replenish capital or to avoid having to stump up
more as a result of the regulatory changes that followed. That HSBC has clung
on to its BoCom stake despite its cost speaks volumes about the bank’s view of
its importance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">BoCom is, though, something of an orphaned holding. HSBC
can’t expand it, and actively selling it would bring the real risk of upsetting
Beijing. Yesterday, the lender was at pains to shrug off the enforced shrinking
and point out that the resulting earnings adjustments will be small.</p><p class="MsoNormal">All true, but Beijing’s loosening of HSBC’s BoCom ties might
be an elegant way for the bank diplomatically to start stepping back from an
investment whose real strategic value no longer looks so compelling.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
