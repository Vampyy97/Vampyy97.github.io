fighting continues in a conflict that has killed more than 30 people and
displaced more than 200,000 along their border.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The two prime ministers are expected to meet in Kuala
Lumpur, after a weekend in which Thailand and Cambodia accused each other of
continued attacks and US President Donald Trump warned both countries that he
would cut off trade talks if they did not agree a ceasefire.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Thailand said yesterday evening that acting Prime Minister
Phumtham Wechayachai had been invited to a meeting by Malaysia’s Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
with Cambodian leader Hun Manet also expected to attend.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Thailand warned that it “reaffirms sovereignty over every
inch of its territory” and there would be “no negotiation on maps”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hun Manet said that he would lead the Cambodian delegation
to the meeting, which he said was “co-organised by the United States and with
participation of China” with the purpose of achieving “an immediate ceasefire”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The announcement came on the heels of Trump’s calls to the
Cambodian and Thai leaders. The worst fighting between Thailand and Cambodia in
more than a decade broke out on Thursday around the Ta Muen temple, which both
countries claim, before spreading to other parts of their border region.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump said in a social media post on Saturday that Cambodia
and Thailand “are also looking to get back to the ‘Trading Table’ with the
United States, which we think is inappropriate to do until such time as the
fighting STOPS”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump has threatened the two countries’ export-reliant
economies with a 36 per cent tariff from August 1.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Thailand’s foreign ministry said yesterday that Wechayachai
had spoken to Trump and that “Thailand agrees in principle to have a ceasefire
in place”, adding that it wanted to see “sincere intention” from Cambodia.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hun Manet said that in his conversation with Trump,
“Cambodia agreed with the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire
between the two armed forces.” He added that he hoped “the Thai side will not
reverse position”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The fighting continued yesterday, according to Thailand’s
army, which said that “the first shots were fired into Thai territory in
several areas including civilian homes”, and that it had “responded in
self-defence at limited military targets” since the violence began. Cambodia
said Thailand had been firing into its territory from 2am.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Thailand has accused Cambodia of targeting civilian areas
and hospitals, which Cambodia's foreign ministry has dismissed as a “baseless
accusation”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday, farmers from the border area in Cambodia could be
seen driving tractors with their possessions and families to safer areas.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A security guard who said he lived about 50km from the Preah
Vihear Hindu temple, a flashpoint in the fighting, said that he had heard about
Trump's intervention.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“I heard the news, but I don’t know why Thailand still fired
at 2am this morning,” Him Sum told the Financial Times at a roadside grocery
shop. “I think if the US wants to stop the war, they can.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
