<p class=MsoNormal><b>Brussels accepts 15% US tariffs to fix ‘unfair trade
relations’, says Trump</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=574 height=391 id="Picture 1"

<p class=MsoNormal>• EU to buy more US arms and energy • Accord with von der
Leyen • Transatlantic strife averted</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HENRY FOY — TURNBERRY<br>
AIME WILLIAMS — WASHINGTON<br>
ANDY BOUNDS — BRUSSELS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The US and EU have struck a trade deal that will impose 15
per cent tariffs on EU products, Donald Trump said yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU has agreed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars
on additional American energy products and weapons as part of the deal, the US
president said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The agreement, which is set to avoid a transatlantic trade
war, was struck during a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von
der Leyen at Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The meeting, which lasted around an hour, saw the sides
agree a deal that was largely hashed out by negotiators earlier last week and
met the EU’s key benchmark of a blanket 15 per cent tariff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Earlier in the day Trump said he wanted to end the bloc’s
“unfair” trade relationship with the US. “We should give it a shot,” Trump said
ahead of the negotiations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sitting next to von der Leyen, Trump said the US-EU trade
relationship was “unfair to the United States … a one-sided relationship”. He
added: “Both sides want fairness.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After reaching the deal, he said that “this is probably the
biggest deal ever reached in any capacity, trade or beyond trade”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump said the EU would spend an additional $750bn on US
energy products, invest $600bn in the US and buy “a vast amount” in US military
equipment worth “hundreds of billions of dollars”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The US president said the US would put tariffs of 15 per
cent on EU goods, including automobiles, in exchange for the bloc “opening up
their countries at zero tariff”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking after the US president, von der Leyen said the new
tariff rate would be “all inclusive”, and described the arrangement as a “good
deal” that had been “tough” to reach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before the meeting von der Leyen said that the EU’s trade
surplus in goods with the US, which hit almost €200bn last year, needed to be
cut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We have to rebalance it,” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The deal is a major victory for Trump, who has spent months
forcing America’s allies into bruising negotiations by threatening steep
tariffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But US trading partners have expressed concern that, even
when they strike agreements with Trump to lower his tariffs, they face
uncertainty over future levies on sectors including pharmaceuticals, chips and
aerospace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EU steel and aluminium imports are exempted from the deal.
Trump said the levies, which he has set at 50 per cent for most countries
across the world, would not be tackled until after an initial agreement with
the EU, dashing the industries’ hopes for an early and low tariff quota.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump had threatened to impose 30 per cent tariffs on EU
products imported into the US if no deal was finalised by August 1, a move that
would almost certainly have sparked retaliation by the bloc and a transatlantic
trade war.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU had prepared a retaliatory package of tariffs of up
to 30 per cent against €92bn of US exports if it could not reach an agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking after the deal was announced, US commerce secretary
Howard Lutnick said the US would unveil new tariffs on chips as a result of its
national security probe into the sector in two weeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>VPN group sees demand rise 1,800% as Britons seek to
evade online safety law</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TIM BRADSHAW — LONDON</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>British internet users have rushed to access services that
disguise a user’s online location after new age verification rules came into
force.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thousands of sites offering adult content, as well as
popular social media apps including X, Reddit and TikTok, have introduced “age
assurance” controls for UK users since Friday to comply with the Online Safety
Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The age checks are designed to prevent children under 18
from accessing sites that carry pornography as well as other harmful material
that relates to self-harm, eating disorders or suicide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But to evade the new rules, a growing number of people are
turning to tools more often used by citizens in authoritarian regimes to get
around internet censorship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Apps offering virtual private networks — which route a
smartphone or PC’s internet traffic through another country, bypassing local
network providers — made up half of the top 10 most popular free apps on the
UK’s App Store for iOS this weekend, according to Apple’s rankings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Proton VPN leapfrogged ChatGPT to become the top free app in
the UK, according to Apple’s daily App Store charts, with similar services from
developers Super Unlimited and Nord Security also rising over the weekend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Proton said it had experienced a more than 1,800 per cent
increase in daily sign-ups from UK-based users. Nord said there had been a
1,000 per cent increase in UK purchases of VPN subscriptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We would normally associate these large spikes in sign-ups
with major civil unrest,” Proton said. “This clearly shows that adults are
concerned about the impact universal age verification laws will have on their
privacy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The UK is one of the first democratic countries to impose
such strict content controls on tech companies, making it a test case that will
be monitored around the world. Several US states and Australia have also sought
to impose age-based restrictions for online services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Platforms in breach of the rules face penalties of up to
£18mn or 10 per cent of global turnover, whichever is greater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Act — which was passed under the previous Conservative
government in 2023 — has also become a potential flashpoint with the US. Trump
administration officials oppose anything they see as a restriction on freedom
of speech.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Israel opens Gaza aid corridors after uproar</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NERI ZILBER — TEL AVIV<br>
HEBA SALEH — CAIRO</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israel said it had started daily “tactical pauses” to
military activity in Gaza and would create “humanitarian corridors” throughout
the strip, an apparent reversal of its policy after months of severe aid
restrictions pushed the enclave to the brink of famine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shift was approved by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu’s government and announced by the Israel Defense Forces amid growing
international condemnation of what UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on
Saturday called the “appalling” humanitarian conditions inside Gaza.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The IDF said the halts to military activity, which began
yesterday, would happen daily from 10am to 8pm in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah and
the Al-Mawasi coastal area, places to which the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.1mn
people have been forcibly displaced and where Israeli ground troops are not
present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, the IDF said the humanitarian corridors would
be in place from 6am to 11pm every day to enable the “safe passage” of aid
convoys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tom Fletcher, the UN relief chief, welcomed the announcement
and said UN teams on the ground “will do all we can to reach as many starving
people as we can in this window”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The World Food Programme also welcomed Israel’s decision to
facilitate access to aid and said it had “enough food in or on its way to the
region to feed the entire population ... for almost three months”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Egyptian Red Crescent said yesterday that it had sent
more than 100 trucks into Gaza carrying more than 1,200 tonnes of flour and 450
tonnes of food packages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, one UN official said they were unclear on how long
the humanitarian corridors would be in place, while another said aid agencies
were in contact with the Israeli military for clarity on details of the new
arrangement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Netanyahu, speaking at an air force base yesterday, said
Israel was allowing the entry of “minimal humanitarian supplies”, as it has
done “up until now”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The UN is creating excuses and lies against the state of
Israel,” he said. “There will be no more excuses. We will continue to act until
we achieve all of our war goals — until total victory.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Israeli air force began parachuting humanitarian
supplies into Gaza on Saturday night, while Jordan and the United Arab Emirates
also airdropped supplies into the enclave yesterday. UK officials said they
were sending additional military planners to Jordan to help co-ordinate the
airdrops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foreign air forces, including those of the UK, France,
Jordan and the UAE, have previously conducted airdrops over Gaza during the
conflict. But humanitarian organisations have criticised them as an inadequate
means of meeting the territory's needs, with one UN official describing them as
a “distraction and a smokescreen”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David Lammy, the UK’s foreign secretary, said that while the
IDF’s announcement was “essential”, it “cannot alleviate the needs of those
desperately suffering in Gaza”. “We need a ceasefire that can end the war, for
hostages to be released and aid to enter Gaza by land unhindered,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Syria and jet deal test Trump and Erdogan bond</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JOHN PAUL RATHBONE — ISTANBUL</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was the body language of an established bromance:
Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US President Donald Trump shook
hands, smiled, then clinched each other at a group photo for the Nato summit in
The Hague last month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “extraordinary” relationship of these two “friends”, as
the pair call each other, has so far delivered a string of mutual wins. Turkey
has secured a better position than many US allies on tariffs. Washington has
lifted sanctions on Syria, as Erdogan wanted. Trump has also turned a blind eye
to Erdogan’s crackdown on the opposition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Erdogan has, meanwhile, provided his fellow Nato ally with a
venue for diplomatic talks with Russia, and the possibility of a US military
exit from Syria, which Trump has long wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, however, their relationship faces two significant
tests. The most urgent involves reconciling Turkey’s support for the government
of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa with destabilising Israeli military actions
in the Arab state. The second is to secure the end of US sanctions on Turkey’s
defence sector to allow a multibillion-dollar F-35 fighter jet deal that
Erdogan has long wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You can’t underestimate their chemistry,” Soner Cagaptay,
director of the Turkey research programme at The Washington Institute
think-tank, said of the two presidents. “Trump likes strong countries and
powerful leaders — Erdogan delivers both.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even so, “for all the talk of their bromance, Trump and
Erdogan don’t actually seem to get any deals done,” said Aaron Stein, president
of the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Washington.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nowhere has the “new era in Turkish-American relations” — as
Erdogan has described it — been more evident than in Syria. Turkey’s neighbour
had long been a source of tension because of clashing US and Turkish priorities
— particularly over US support for Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers an
extension of the militant group PKK.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But now Washington appears to all but repeat Turkish talking
points — even when they run counter to Israel’s, which has taken a hostile
stance towards Sharaa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In June, after speaking with Erdogan, Trump used his
executive powers to lift economic sanctions on Syria, a key Turkish ask. Then
the US this month moved to delist as a terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,
the Syrian president’s former movement — making HTS perhaps the first terror
organisation ever to be delisted by the US before it became defunct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This was a big deal for Turkey. It was also a sign of
Trump’s faith in Erdogan,” Cagaptay said. “If Syria is stable, more of the over
3mn Syrian refugees living in Turkey will go back. That in turn helps with
nationalist issues inside Turkey and is a potential vote winner for Erdogan.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tom Barrack, one of Trump’s friends and the new US
ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, is a crucial go-between. Trump
has tasked Barrack — a smooth talking but tough private equity billionaire of
Lebanese descent — with elevating the bilateral relationship from “great” to
“extraordinary”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Barrack criticised Israel for creating “another very
confusing chapter” after it launched dozens of air strikes in Syria during a
wave of deadly sectarian clashes this month, saying it was acting to protect
the Druze religious minority. This rare public censure of Israel from a US
official appeared to provoke a tacit rebuttal from Israel’s defence minister
Israel Katz: “Those who criticise the attacks are not well versed in the
facts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second big test of the Trump-Erdogan relationship is
Turkey’s long-held desire to buy dozens of F-35 stealth fighter jets — a deal
that Erdogan sounded positive about after meeting Trump at The Hague, saying:
“Inshallah, we shall make progress.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the obstacles are formidable. The deal was blocked in
2020 under so-called CAATSA sanctions after Erdogan bought two Russian S-400
air defence batteries. Turkish officials have alluded to the S-400s remaining
stored in unopened crates ever since. But “if used, it would be like Russia
plugging a USB stick into Nato’s computer system,” one western official said.
“That is totally unacceptable for us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Barrack has suggested that a solution, including the
congressional approval required to lift the sanctions, might be found by the
end of this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the meantime, Turkey is seeking to recapitalise its
ageing air fleet by buying Eurofighter jets. Britain and Turkey signed a
preliminary multibillion-pound deal for the sale of Typhoon jets to Ankara last
week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the F-35s, “the successful formula will require both
sides to agree to some concessions to their doctrinal positions,” said Sinan
Ulgen, director of EDAM, an Istanbul think-tank. “Turkey will in essence have
to commit to never using the S-400 in practice — with monitoring to assuage the
trust deficit … But the US will have to show flexibility too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The stakes are high. If the issue is resolved, Lockheed
Martin could get a multibillion-dollar sales order. Turkish companies could
also get reinserted into the F-35 programme, regaining lucrative contracts that
once included building F-35 fuselages and serving as one of the jet’s main
maintenance hubs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s going to be a long haul,” cautioned Stein. “To buy the
F-35s, Turkey will need military financing — which requires congressional
approval. But Turkey is not popular in Congress, and the Greeks and Israeli
lobby will oppose the deal.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Analysts argue that where there is a will there is a way,
and expect that the F-35 deal will get done one day — even if that requires a
Trump executive order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harder to resolve are the growing tensions between Turkey
and Israel. Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said last week Ankara might
intervene if there were further attempts to divide Syria — a prospect that
raises the alarming possibility of clashes between the region’s two most
powerful militaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is Iran. Turkey bit its tongue when the US bombed
Iran’s nuclear facilities in June, issuing only a mild rebuke. But Ankara could
fall out completely with the US if there were to be a second round of the
Israel-Iran war that dealt more blows to Tehran and which led to a huge influx
of Iranian refugees into neighbouring Turkey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Berlin to avoid EU punishment for breaching budget rules</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PAOLA TAMMA — BRUSSELS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Germany will escape punishment for breaching strict EU
budget rules, thanks to an exemption that applies to its increase in defence
spending, Brussels’ top economic official has said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Europe's largest economy is forecast to record an excess
deficit of 3.3 per cent in 2025, but this is fully accounted for by an increase
in defence spending, EU economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told the
Financial Times. Berlin, therefore, “is likely not to end up in [the] excessive
deficit procedure,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EU rules — which Germany helped design — dictate that
member states must keep their budget deficit within 3 per cent of GDP and
public debt below 60 per cent of GDP. A country could face fines if it does not
take corrective measures to meet the rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A final assessment of Germany’s position will take place
next spring when full data for 2025 is available, Dombrovskis said, adding: “We
have to see the execution, because it’s close, [but] if everything holds, then
it should not be the case for this year’s budget.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Berlin’s narrow escape signals a willingness from Brussels
to allow the bloc’s largest economy to spend lavishly at a time of higher
defence needs and low growth. Germany plans to exceed a 3 per cent annual
deficit threshold this year to the end of 2027, according to its own fiscal
plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the “national escape clause,” invoked by Germany and 15
other EU countries, allows member states to spend up to 1.5 per cent of their
output on defence over four years without breaking the rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clause was added at Germany's behest this year to
accommodate higher defence spending, given US demands on EU countries to boost
their own security and a new Nato target to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence
by 2035.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The request was a stark about-face from Germany, which
during a recent reform of fiscal rules asked for strict safeguards for
countries that breached EU debt and deficit thresholds. In negotiations over
the past few months with Berlin over its fiscal plan, Brussels granted Germany
a right to “backload” measures to reduce its budget deficit towards the later
years of its plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brussels has also accepted Germany’s estimate for the
potential growth impact of Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s €500bn infrastructure
investment fund and increased defence spending at 0.9 per cent on average until
2041 — up from 0.3 per cent in 2025 — something German officials stress is
allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brussels’ leniency towards Berlin is due to its relatively
low debt levels, projected to come in only slightly above the EU's 60 per cent
threshold at 63.8 per cent of GDP this year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The commission has been quite lax in its interpretation of
the fiscal rules towards Germany,” said Guntram Wolff, a senior fellow at
think-tank Bruegel and a professor of economics at the Free University of
Brussels. “At some level, that is understandable given that debt levels are low
and also the deficit levels are small compared to France. At another level, it
is weakening the just reformed fiscal rules.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Procurement chief vows to continue supplier price squeeze</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JOE MILLER — WASHINGTON<br>
STEPHEN MORRIS — SAN FRANCISCO<br>
STEPHEN FOLEY — NEW YORK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Trump administration’s procurement chief has vowed to
persist with a Doge-inspired pricing squeeze on technology groups and
government suppliers, after some of the US’s largest corporations complained to
the White House about his aggressive approach to cost-cutting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Josh Gruenbaum, a former investment banker and director at
KKR who runs the powerful Federal Acquisition Service, has overseen a
months-long review of multibillion-dollar deals with software providers and
consultancies, convincing companies including Booz Allen Hamilton, Google and
Oracle to offer steep discounts on services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Gruenbaum’s sometimes brusque approach — demanding that
the likes of Microsoft, Amazon and Uber identify savings or face the possible
cancellation of lucrative contracts — has sent shockwaves through the tech and
consultancy industries. A letter from Gruenbaum sent to 10 leading consulting
firms in March demanding they justify each individual government contract read:
“A 15-year-old should be able to understand what service you provide and why it
is important — no consultative jargon or gobbledegook.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At least one chief executive complained directly to the
White House over the approach, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One leading US tech group said dealing with the
administration was impossible, and described it as a “circus”. “They are super
aggressive and have upset CEOs and others,” another government contractor told
the Financial Times. They added that airline industry executives were the
latest to complain about the FAS after learning their sector was the next to be
targeted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a recent interview with the FT, Gruenbaum claimed all
negotiations had taken place in good faith. “I can’t think of a single
contentious or caustic discussion I've had with industry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The General Services Administration, which houses the FAS,
claims the procurement review has resulted in more than $52bn in savings, of
which about $12bn comes from consulting contracts. The total figure accounts
for more than a quarter of the purported savings by the so-called Department of
Government Efficiency, or Doge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gruenbaum insisted his team’s approach was “going to persist
for the duration of this administration”. He added that multibillion-dollar
deals were still being reviewed against cheaper options.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We have shrewd business folks around us, we do run market
comparisons,” said Gruenbaum, whose role became more prominent after an
executive order further centralising procurement. “We have typically other
vendors who are like, ‘we could create proper market tension.’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He warned companies that “volume’s going to start shifting”
if government suppliers failed to offer value for money on existing contracts,
“and I think industry understands that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gruenbaum denied the White House was pressing him to go easy
on companies with close ties to the administration, such as Larry Ellison’s
Oracle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The buy-in from … the administration, for us to go and
execute on these things, that’s what’s making this happen,” he told the FT.
“We're not here to, like, just knuckle-drag people,” he said. “There’s a way to
get to a great deal where it’s a win-win, where you recognise ... how important
of a customer the federal government is.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The White House did not respond to a request for comment on
the complaints by chief executives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a subsequent statement, Gruenbaum defended his team’s
approach, saying: “We are tough, but fair, and we take our jobs safeguarding
American taxpayer money extremely seriously — we make no apologies for that. We
stand by our record of success.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Fox-style media site accused of stoking culture war in
Germany</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LAURA PITEL — BERLIN</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Leading a tour around the Berlin offices of his rightwing
online media outlet NIUS, editor-in-chief Julian Reichelt says that someone
once claimed that the old brick building used to house a toilet factory. It is,
he laughs, an easy metaphor for his critics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt, a former editor of powerful tabloid Bild who fell
from grace, is accused of stoking tensions over a top judge’s appointment, a
controversy that has plunged the ruling coalition into crisis and raised fears
that Germany is descending into US-style culture wars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now he is the face of an outlet that models itself on the
“frontal, very tough opinion format” of Rupert Murdoch's Fox News. NIUS was one
of the most active “alternative” rightwing sites that ran a deluge of negative
coverage about one of three constitutional court nominees, eventually prompting
the government to cancel a vote on the appointment this month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt seems unsure whether he wants to dispute the idea
of his influence on the vote or be proud of it. “I think it’s predictable and
ridiculous,” he said of the notion that the decision was swung by an online
campaign. “I think it’s what the left in this culture war always claims as soon
as they’re losing.” But he added: “I am more than willing to take the credit
for shaping the debate. And I am very proud of that. I love it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Founded two years ago with a yellow-orange logo and the
slogan “the voice of the majority”, NIUS today has just 43 staff and fewer than
6,000 paying subscribers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is still lossmaking — but is bankrolled by conservative
businessman Frank Gotthardt, who is also a donor to Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s
Christian Democrats (CDU).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Its YouTube viewing figures suggest that it reaches around
250,000 people a day with its flagship two-hour morning live show, which
features negative stories about asylum seekers, questions science on climate
change and rallies against “woke” culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Critics say there is a kind of symbiotic relationship with
the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), with the site echoing the party's
talking points and party officials sharing NIUS content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt says he doesn't “give a fuck” about who retweets
him and that he was not collaborating with the AfD, saying: “I've never
collaborated with any politician in my life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The site depicted constitutional court nominee Frauke
Brosius-Gersdorf as a “radical feminist” who advocated for abortion up until
the final weeks of pregnancy — a claim she has denied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Growing unease within the ruling CDU led to a backlash
against her nomination even though it had already been agreed behind the scenes
with their Social Democrat coalition partners, eventually causing a vote in the
Bundestag to be cancelled. Merz later hit out at the “unacceptable” campaign
against her, which he said amounted to “massive personal defamation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An analysis by the political consultancy Polisphere found
that NIUS published 20 negative stories about Brosius-Gersdorf in the nine days
before the failed vote, homing in on the sensitive subject of abortion, which
is illegal in Germany but in practice decriminalised up to the 12th week of
pregnancy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There were false allegations and slander — and other media
joined in,” said Philipp Salhoff, the company’s managing director. “The new and
interesting thing about this campaign was that it was so successful.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That assessment is not universally shared. Andreas Rodder, a
historian and a conservative standard bearer for Merz’s CDU, said it was too
simple to attribute the fiasco to the online media, adding that a “very broad
and diverse” coalition emerged against Brosius-Gersdorf’s nomination within the
CDU and its Bavarian sister party the CSU.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But one official from the Catholic Church told the Financial
Times that some senior clergy felt chastened after consuming and sharing claims
about the law professor that they later realised misrepresented her views. “We
have to think more carefully in future about our words and how they can be
instrumentalised,” the official said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt says that he is “pro-choice” on abortion and
generally “way more liberal than people would assume,” although he believes
there should be a cut-off point in pregnancy when termination is no longer
allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Critics of the 45-year-old are deeply suspicious about the
game plan behind NIUS — and Reichelt’s own personal motives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Hamburg-born son of two journalists, he rose to become
the top editor of Axel Springer’s Bild in 2017. But he was fired four years
later after facing allegations of lying to his employers over sexual
relationships with junior female staff — claims that he continues to deny and
battle in court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Andreas Audretsch, a Green MP who regularly locks horns with
the NIUS editor online, believes that Reichelt is driven by a “dangerous”
amalgamation of both political and personal goals, fuelled by the idea that
leftwing culture wars destroyed his career.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He seems to think that, if he is able to destroy the system
and the rules of our society, then something else will emerge,” he said. “And I
guess he doesn’t care if this is a rightwing extremist government.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reichelt denied that he was seeking to destroy German
democracy. “Criticising the powerful is keeping the system of democracy alive,”
he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He said that he believes the AfD, which claimed a historic
second place finish in February elections and this year was labelled rightwing
extremist by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, has a few “ugly” figures
but added: “I don’t think it’s a Nazi party.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He also believes that the pact formed by mainstream parties
to avoid co-operating or forming coalitions with the AfD is “an insane
concept.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think we should be way more relaxed with the AfD because
we're a grown democracy,” he said. “We will be able to deal with it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Though shunned by most mainstream politicians, NIUS has
interviewed Jens Spahn and Markus Söder, senior figures from the CDU-CSU who
are both on the right of the conservative alliance. Audretsch, the Green MP,
said that such interviews signalled to conservative MPs “that it’s OK to talk
to Julian Reichelt, that NIUS is important — and if they're launching a
campaign, please start listening.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Thailand and Cambodia to meet for talks</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JOHN REED AND SUN NARIN — SIEM REAP</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Thai and Cambodian leaders will meet for talks today as
fighting continues in a conflict that has killed more than 30 people and
displaced more than 200,000 along their border.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two prime ministers are expected to meet in Kuala
Lumpur, after a weekend in which Thailand and Cambodia accused each other of
continued attacks and US President Donald Trump warned both countries that he
would cut off trade talks if they did not agree a ceasefire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand said yesterday evening that acting Prime Minister
Phumtham Wechayachai had been invited to a meeting by Malaysia’s Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
with Cambodian leader Hun Manet also expected to attend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand warned that it “reaffirms sovereignty over every
inch of its territory” and there would be “no negotiation on maps”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hun Manet said that he would lead the Cambodian delegation
to the meeting, which he said was “co-organised by the United States and with
participation of China” with the purpose of achieving “an immediate ceasefire”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The announcement came on the heels of Trump’s calls to the
Cambodian and Thai leaders. The worst fighting between Thailand and Cambodia in
more than a decade broke out on Thursday around the Ta Muen temple, which both
countries claim, before spreading to other parts of their border region.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump said in a social media post on Saturday that Cambodia
and Thailand “are also looking to get back to the ‘Trading Table’ with the
United States, which we think is inappropriate to do until such time as the
fighting STOPS”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump has threatened the two countries’ export-reliant
economies with a 36 per cent tariff from August 1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand’s foreign ministry said yesterday that Wechayachai
had spoken to Trump and that “Thailand agrees in principle to have a ceasefire
in place”, adding that it wanted to see “sincere intention” from Cambodia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hun Manet said that in his conversation with Trump,
“Cambodia agreed with the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire
between the two armed forces.” He added that he hoped “the Thai side will not
reverse position”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fighting continued yesterday, according to Thailand’s
army, which said that “the first shots were fired into Thai territory in
several areas including civilian homes”, and that it had “responded in
self-defence at limited military targets” since the violence began. Cambodia
said Thailand had been firing into its territory from 2am.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thailand has accused Cambodia of targeting civilian areas
and hospitals, which Cambodia's foreign ministry has dismissed as a “baseless
accusation”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yesterday, farmers from the border area in Cambodia could be
seen driving tractors with their possessions and families to safer areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A security guard who said he lived about 50km from the Preah
Vihear Hindu temple, a flashpoint in the fighting, said that he had heard about
Trump's intervention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I heard the news, but I don’t know why Thailand still fired
at 2am this morning,” Him Sum told the Financial Times at a roadside grocery
shop. “I think if the US wants to stop the war, they can.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Chile's far right advances as gangs cloud election</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CIARA NUGENT — SANTIAGO</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A surge in organised crime has reshaped Chile’s politics
ahead of November’s presidential poll, handing the country’s far right its best
chance at winning power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chile, one of Latin America’s safest and wealthiest nations,
has suffered its first big wave of gang crime over the past five years, as
groups from Venezuela and elsewhere have expanded Chile’s previously niche
markets for drugs, human trafficking and extortion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kidnappings, dismemberments and other once unheard-of
violent crimes have flooded local media and Chile’s murder rate has more than
doubled since 2015. Chileans have long ranked security among their top
concerns, but polls show the issue eclipses all others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That has benefited José Antonio Kast, a politician on his
third run for president who has made a career criticising governments’ handling
of crime and immigration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arturo Squella, president of Kast’s Republicano party, told
the Financial Times: “Chileans can clearly see that the other competitive
candidates have not had the determination to tackle drug traffickers and
organised crime head on. They see that determination in José Antonio Kast.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast promises to draw inspiration from El Salvador’s
President Nayib Bukele, and build a border barrier to keep out undocumented
migrants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A poll by opinion research group Cadem in July projected
Kast to win 27 per cent of the vote, putting him just behind the leftwing
coalition’s candidate, Jeannette Jara, at 29 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But several other rightwingers jointly scored about 25 per
cent, and analysts say Kast would more easily pick up those votes in a run-off
in December, making the election his to lose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast and Jara have political baggage that may put off
moderate voters. Kast, a son of German immigrants and a father of nine, is a
defender of Chile’s divisive 20th-century rightwing dictator Augusto Pinochet.
Jara is a member of the Communist party, which supports authoritarian regimes
in Cuba and North Korea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A Pinochetista has never won an election in Chile, but
neither has a communist,” said Patricio Navia, a professor at New York
University. “This looks like an unprecedented election.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crime, along with lacklustre economic growth, has battered
the popularity of leftist President Gabriel Boric, a former student leader. He
is barred from running for a second consecutive term under Chile’s
constitution. Jara was his labour minister.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boric’s government devoted the first half of his term to
failed efforts to expand Chile’s welfare state and overhaul its constitution. A
later pivot to focus on security, which he now calls his “number one priority”,
was not enough to convince voters and his approval ratings have rarely risen
above 30 per cent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Officials say the arrival of hundreds of thousands of
migrants from crisis-stricken Venezuela, combined with a pullback in state
presence during the pandemic lockdowns, has allowed poorly policed informal
settlements to blossom and created a pool of vulnerable people to exploit,
particularly in northern Chile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Santiago has also changed. Downtown walls are still
plastered with graffiti from protests in 2019 over the cost of living. Informal
street vendors have proliferated and stores shut earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fatal shootings have frequently occurred in bustling
neighbourhoods around the capital’s Central Station and in July authorities
uncovered what appeared to be a “torture house” used by gangs. “Muggers used to
just take your cell phone, but now they’ll shoot you... people don’t go out at
night any more,” said Marco Gonzalez, who sells bathroom fixtures in the area
and plans to vote for Kast. “The government has been too weak to control it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boric’s government has increased security spending, passed
laws targeting organised crime and jailed hundreds of gang members, including
from Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The homicide rate has fallen slightly, from a peak of 6.7
per 100,000 residents in 2022 to six per 100,000 in 2024, and remains among the
lowest in Latin America. But other offences remain stubbornly high. A
government survey published in July found 5.8 per cent of Chileans had been the
victim of a violent crime last year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The state has intensely pursued these criminals ... and we
are achieving results,” security minister Luis Cordero said. “Of course, I
would like the results to come faster, but some will only be visible in the
medium or long term.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast argues the government has not gone far enough. He vows
to strengthen legal protections for police officers who use force, and make it
easier to deport migrants for entering illegally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last year, Kast visited El Salvador’s 40,000-capacity
mega-jail, whose harsh conditions have become the centrepiece of Bukele’s
crackdown on gangs. Squella said they would import “all the elements that are
appropriate in Chile”, including cutting off imprisoned gang members’ contact
with the outside world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We will reclaim the state’s right to use force, restore a
sense of authority, and make police work more proactive,” he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jara, meanwhile, has pledged to recover gang-controlled
neighbourhoods “by investing in infrastructure, culture and a permanent state
presence” and change banking laws to make it easier to track money laundering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kast remains the favourite, but analysts said Jara, a
charismatic speaker who grew up in a working-class neighbourhood, was proving
to be an unexpectedly strong candidate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s a strong anti-elitism message within her, which has
worked in many countries recently,” said Robert Funk, an associate professor of
political science at the University of Chile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>China argues for global body to govern AI in challenge to
US dominance</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WILLIAM LANGLEY — GUANGZHOU<br>
ELEANOR OLCOTT AND RYAN MCMORROW — SHANGHAI</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China has unveiled a sweeping plan to expand its role in
artificial intelligence governance, including the creation of a global
co-operation organisation, as Beijing vies with Washington for technological
leadership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking at the opening of the World Artificial Intelligence
Conference in Shanghai on Saturday, Chinese premier Li Qiang said AI innovation
was hindered by “bottlenecks” such as the supply of computer chips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Without explicitly mentioning the US, he took aim at
“technological monopolies” and restrictions that could lead to AI becoming “an
exclusive game for a few countries and companies”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Currently, overall global AI governance is still
fragmented. Countries have great differences, particularly in terms of areas
such as regulatory concepts [and] institutional rules,” Li said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We should strengthen co-ordination to form a global AI
governance framework that has broad consensus as soon as possible,” he said,
adding that China would help create “a world AI co-operation organisation”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Li spoke, the foreign ministry published a 13-point
plan for the global governance of AI that proposed the creation of two new AI
dialogue mechanisms under the auspices of the UN and a safety governance
framework.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In recent months, Beijing has promoted China’s “open”
innovation and willingness to “share indigenous technologies”. The country’s
top AI groups, DeepSeek and Alibaba, have made their large language models, or
LLMs, available to developers worldwide as open-source technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s plan includes a push for greater co-operation on
open-source technology through new transnational platforms and developer
communities, and sharing of crucial software and hardware such as
semiconductors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The country’s swath of advanced open-source LLMs has raised
concerns in the US that low-cost Chinese tech will undermine Silicon Valley’s
global dominance and pricing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Li’s comments reflect the intense rivalry with the US over
the technology, with Washington restricting exports to China of advanced
semiconductors and the equipment used to make them, and pressing allies to do
the same. China has still managed to make advances, with the release of an LLM
by Hangzhou-based DeepSeek this year that sparked a debate about whether the US
could maintain its technological edge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We are willing to provide more Chinese solutions to the
international community and contribute more Chinese wisdom to global artificial
intelligence governance,” Li said, adding that AI would be a new engine of
economic growth. He said China was especially eager to share technologies with
countries in the global south to “make the achievements of AI development
better benefit the world”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s foreign ministry said it had invited representatives
from more than 40 countries and international organisations to attend the
four-day AI conference and exhibition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>China’s plan comes days after the White House unveiled a
plan to achieve US dominance in AI. It focused on accelerating innovation by
cutting red tape, building infrastructure and ensuring the US led in
international AI diplomacy and security.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Brazil to increase its Brics commitment in defiance of
Trump</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MICHAEL STOTT — BRASILIA</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brazil will double down on its commitment to the Brics bloc,
the Brazilian president’s top foreign policy adviser has said, a move that
defies US President Donald Trump’s threats to impose punitive tariffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trump has taken aim at Brazil twice this month. As the
country hosted a summit for the 11-member Brics, he threatened a 10 per cent
tariff against any nation “aligning themselves” with the “anti-American” bloc.
Trump then pledged 50 per cent levies on Brazil and demanded it end the trial
of hard-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is charged with plotting a
coup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Celso Amorim, lead foreign affairs adviser to leftwing
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, told the Financial Times those attacks
“are reinforcing our relations with the Brics, because we want to have
diversified relations and not depend on any one country.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On top of the Brics — which includes China, Russia and India
— Amorim said Brazil would look to bolster relations with other countries in
Europe, South America and Asia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 50 per cent tariff is among the highest mentioned by the
US president in his current round of negotiations, despite Brazil running a
trade deficit with the US in goods — unlike many other countries targeted.
Trump also blasted Lula’s government for what he said are attacks on free
speech, a “ridiculous censorship regime” and “very unfair” trade practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lula has rejected Trump's tactics, saying the US president
was elected “not to be emperor of the world”. He added that if Trump’s actions
during the January 6 Capitol insurrection had been committed in Brazil, he
would be standing trial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amorim said Trump’s interference in Brazil’s internal
affairs was something not seen “even in colonial times”. “I don’t think even
the Soviet Union would have done anything like this,” he said, adding that
Trump “was trying to act politically inside [Brazil] in favour of his friend.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While China is the country’s biggest trading partner,
importing $94bn of mainly agricultural goods and minerals from Brazil last
year, Amorim said “it’s not our intention” for Beijing to be the clear winner
from Trump’s higher tariffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amorim denied that the Brics is ideological. He called for
the EU to quickly ratify a long-stalled trade treaty with the Mercosur group of
South American countries. “If the EU were intelligent, it would ratify it not
just for the immediate economic gain but also for more balance in its
relations,” Amorim said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amorim said Canada was interested in negotiating a free
trade deal with Brazil, and added that the last year of Lula’s government was
likely to see greater focus on South America.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remembering the diplomatic maxim that “countries have no
friends, only interests,” Amorim said Trump was an unusual case because he had
“neither friends nor interests, just wishes”. The US president’s approach is
“an illustration of absolute power,” he said.</p>
