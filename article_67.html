steroids’</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><i>George Steer — New York</i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img height="353" src="FT_files/image035.jpg" width="602"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">A new generation of high-octane crypto ventures are
expanding risk-taking with new forms of digital asset loans, three years after
a market crash triggered a wave of insolvencies for lenders across the
industry.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A San Francisco-based lender called Divine Research said it
had extended roughly 30,000 unbacked short-term loans since December, working
with OpenAI chief Sam Altman’s iris-scanning crypto group World to identify
borrowers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Crypto lending — a highly risky part of the digital assets
market — blew up in 2022 after a fall in crypto asset prices triggered a spiral
of defaults and bankruptcies, culminating in the collapse of the FTX exchange.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The so-called crypto winter that followed lasted for almost
two years. But President Donald Trump’s unabashed embrace of digital assets has
sent investors flooding back into the market. The price of bitcoin has raced to
record highs and major financial institutions like JPMorgan are considering
dipping their toes into crypto lending.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We're loaning to average folks like high-school teachers,
fruit vendors... basically anyone with access to the internet can get access to
our funds,” Divine’s founder Diego Estevez told the Financial Times. “This is
microfinance on steroids.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Divine offers loans of less than $1,000 worth of Circle’s
stablecoin USDC — a crypto asset that matches the value of the US dollar — to
cash-strapped consumers, mostly overseas. It describes its borrowers as
underserved by “traditional institutions.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">It uses Altman’s iris-scanning system to make sure borrowers
who default on their loans cannot create a new account. The loans mostly come
with fixed interest rates of between 20 and 30 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Among Divine’s peers is crypto group 3Jane, which in June
received $5.2mn in seed funding from venture group Paradigm — which previously
invested in FTX.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The start-up is already extending uncollateralised USDC
credit lines on the Ethereum blockchain. 3Jane says borrowers have to show
“verifiable proofs” of crypto, bank assets or future cash flows to back the
loan but do not have to hand over any collateral.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Unsecured lending is inherently risky because there are no
assets available to recoup losses if a borrower defaults. But it represents a
huge opportunity for the crypto industry, insiders say.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Defaulted loans on the 3Jane protocol are sold to US
collections agencies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">3Jane is also developing a new lending platform that would
involve AI agents, programmes that can execute tasks based on user
instructions. These agents would be “programmatically obliged to follow debt
covenants” and could therefore be lent to “at much lower rates,” 3Jane says.</p><p class="MsoNormal">US-listed crypto exchange Coinbase in March said it had
teamed up with Altman’s OpenAI to create AI agents with their own crypto
wallets and “equipped with commercial and monetary capabilities.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Another protocol called Wildcat is built for market makers
and crypto trading firms seeking to establish “highly customisable, fixed-rate,
undercollateralised credit facilities” using Ethereum, the second-largest
crypto ecosystem.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Roughly $170mn has so far been lent on its platform.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Like peers Clearpool and TrueFi, Wildcat allows approved
borrowers to create markets where they specify their own terms, such as
interest rates, maturity, and maximum loan capacity.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Default rates for the first loan taken out average about 40
per cent, Estevez said. High interest rates “compensate for these losses,” and
free tokens issued to anyone who scans their eye using World can be “partially”
reclaimed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Most of Divine’s borrowers are not regular users of crypto
before signing up. The scheme was piloted in Argentina, which has suffered
years of steep inflation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Loans are funded by deposits from individuals, who Estevez
said are typically people seeking “good yields.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">He added: “Anyone can provide liquidity. We’ve engineered
the system such that, after accounting for default rates and the interest rates
on offer, providers will always make a profit.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Crypto lending funded by individuals was at the centre of
the 2022 crash when lenders like Celsius and Genesis were unable to pay back
their depositors and filed for bankruptcy. Celsius chief executive Alex
Mashinsky was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud and market
manipulation. Genesis agreed to a $2bn settlement to resolve a lawsuit brought
by New York’s attorney-general, alleging that it defrauded more than 230,000
investors. Genesis did not acknowledge wrongdoing in the case.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Unsecured loans make up a small fraction of the
multibillion-dollar crypto lending market where groups including Coinbase,
Tether and Galaxy dominate. Major Wall Street banks have also begun extending
collateralised loans to some crypto holders. Cantor Fitzgerald this month
announced a $2bn “Bitcoin Financing Business” initiative to provide leverage to
investors who hold the world’s most valuable digital asset.</p></body></html>
