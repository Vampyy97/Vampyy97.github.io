times is most definitely a trend. Spanish utility Iberdrola last week joined
the UK’s National Grid and Belgium’s Elia in raising money for new investments
in electricity grids. The group’s €5bn equity raise will not be the sector’s
last.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Electricity networks in Europe and the US need huge
investment. In Europe, grids tend to be older. And the continent’s commitment
to clean energy — which means more electric vehicles and heat pumps — entails
big increases in transmission and distribution capacity.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Overall, European networks will attract €800bn of capital
expenditure between 2024 and 2033, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated last year,
sharply increasing the asset base on which their regulated returns are
calculated. Iberdrola reckons its network assets will increase from more than
€51bn at the end of this year to over €90bn by the end of 2031. That’s a 10 per
cent compound annual growth rate. The UK and US account for a big chunk of the
new investments.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some utilities will opt for fresh equity because they
already run a tight financial ship. Cutting dividends is unpopular with
investors in a sector traditionally bought for its defensive qualities and high
yields. Iberdrola’s net debt to EBITDA ratio is 3.3 times, Mediobanca said. SSE
and E.On are more highly geared on RBC numbers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The good news is that raising equity to fund growth is not
unpopular with investors. National Grid’s huge £7bn rights issue last year
caused the stock to crash but it has since recovered. That ought to be
especially true for Iberdrola, which thinks regulators will allow it to set
tariffs for its networks such that it makes a nominal post-tax return of 9.5
per cent on the new money it has raised.</p><p class="MsoNormal">That allowed it to sell shares in an accelerated
bookbuilding at a discount of less than 5 per cent to the previous day’s
closing share price last week.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The appeal of companies that build electricity networks in
Europe is not yet reflected in their shares, which typically trade at a
pedestrian mid-teens multiple of expected earnings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Utilities in general are defensive with long-term
investments and returns set by regulators. But electricity grid builders, given
their role in the energy transition, are poised for rapid growth in both assets
and earnings. That’s a powerful combination.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
