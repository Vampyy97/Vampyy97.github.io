record growth in its all-important US business as the UK’s biggest drugmaker
prepares to invest billions in the market ahead of potential tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The FTSE 100 group said yesterday that sales in the US were
up 14 per cent in the quarter from a year earlier, helping to drive an 11 per
cent increase in overall revenues to $14.5bn — easily beating analyst forecasts
of $14.15bn. AstraZeneca reported growth across multiple treatment types,
including an 18 per cent rise in oncology sales.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Its earnings come after AstraZeneca last week said it would
invest $50bn in the US by 2030, in the latest funding pledge by an
international drug company ahead of the potential imposition of tariffs on the
sector by President Donald Trump. The US accounts for 44 per cent of the
company’s revenues.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US is conducting a so-called Section 232 probe into the
national security implications of imports of pharmaceuticals and ingredients.
On Sunday, the US and EU agreed to a 15 per cent tariff on pharmaceuticals
exports from the European bloc.</p><p class="MsoNormal">AstraZeneca’s “landmark investment” in the US reflected “not
only America’s importance but also our confidence in our innovative medicines
to transform global health and power AstraZeneca’s ambition to deliver $80bn
revenue by 2030”, chief executive Sir Pascal Soriot said yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It hailed a strong pipeline of potential new drugs. Soriot
noted 12 positive late-stage clinical trial results during the first half of
the year, including for treatments for hypertension, lung cancer and
generalised myasthenia gravis, a chronic neuromuscular disease. AstraZeneca has
also cited encouraging trial results for breast and gastric cancer therapies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The drugmaker’s pre-tax profit for the second quarter
climbed to $3.1bn in the period from $2.4bn a year earlier. Its shares rose 3.4
per cent in London yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company’s project to boost its manufacturing and
research operations in the US includes a “cornerstone” multibillion-dollar
centre in Virginia to make drug ingredients. It also plans new or expanded
facilities in Maryland, Massachusetts, California, Indiana and Texas.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Several of AstraZeneca’s rivals have announced their own
large US investments, including a $50bn plan unveiled by Swiss group Roche in
April. Companies in the sector are awaiting details of the impact of the US-EU
tariffs agreement struck at the weekend by Trump and Ursula von der Leyen,
European Commission president. Trump suggested pharmaceuticals companies with a
significant US manufacturing presence might be treated favourably.</p></body></html>
