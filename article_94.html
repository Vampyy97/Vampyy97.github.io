eat into US sales</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Profit outlook cut • €60bn wiped off value • Ozempic and
Wegovy hopes dim • Next chief named</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">MAXINE KELLY AND MICHAEL PEEL — LONDON</p><p class="MsoNormal">Novo Nordisk’s shares plunged more than a fifth yesterday,
wiping in excess of €60bn from its value, after it slashed sales and profit
forecasts for the year amid competition from US copycat weight-loss drugs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Danish manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy, previously
Europe's largest company in terms of market capitalisation, warned that
full-year sales growth was expected to be 8-14 per cent, sharply lower than its
May estimate of 13-21 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The group also downgraded its forecast for profit growth for
the year, from 16-24 per cent to 10-16 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Novo’s shares closed down more than 23 per cent,
overshadowing its appointment of a new chief executive.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The woes reflect competition in the US weight-loss market
from both Novo’s rival Eli Lilly and from “compounded” — copycat — versions of
the Danish company’s products.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"For Wegovy in the US, the sales outlook reflects the
persistent use of compounded [drugs], slower than expected market expansion and
competition," said Novo.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Multiple entities continue to sell compounded [drugs]
under the false guise of ‘personalisation’."</p><p class="MsoNormal">The new forecasts also reflected lower expectations for
Ozempic in the US diabetes market and Wegovy in some international markets, it
added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sales in the first six months of the year rose 18 per cent
after the effect of currency fluctuations was stripped out, Novo said.
Operating profit was up 29 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Novo also announced that it was appointing Maziar Mike
Doustdar, current executive vice-president of international operations, as
chief executive.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Doustdar will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen in the top
job next week and will also become president of the group. Jorgensen was ousted
in May after shares in the company fell more than 50 per cent over 12 months.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Doustdar, an Austrian-Iranian national, is the first
non-Dane to head the company. His appointment follows a search that emphasised
the commercial nous needed for the US, after what some analysts see as an
inferior marketing operation to Eli Lilly’s. Doustdar is a lifelong Novo
employee who runs every market apart from the US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Novo’s problems with copycat drugs in the US date back to
2022 shortages of Wegovy and Ozempic, as well as of Eli Lilly’s weight-loss
treatment Zepbound. The US Food and Drug Administration responded at the time
by allowing other companies to make versions of the medicines.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While the FDA ended that permission this year, Novo has
struggled to stem the supply of these alternative medicines.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company said yesterday that it was pursuing litigation
“to protect patients from copycat... drugs".</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Novo Nordisk market research shows that unsafe and
unlawful mass compounding has continued," it said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Multiple entities continue to market and sell
compounded [drugs] under the false guise of ‘personalisation’."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Last month the company ended a partnership with US
telehealth group Hims &amp; Hers after Novo alleged it was deceptively
marketing copycat versions of Wegovy. Hims &amp; Hers accused Novo of
"misleading the public" and said it refused to be "strong-armed
by any pharmaceutical company’s anti-competitive demands."</p></body></html>
