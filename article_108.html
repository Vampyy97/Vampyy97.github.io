narrow losses</p><p class="MsoNormal">ZEHRA MUNIR — NEW YORK<br/>
SYLVIA PFEIFER — LONDON</p><p class="MsoNormal">Boeing’s chief executive has said the company’s turnaround
plan is running ahead of schedule as increased commercial-jet deliveries drove
revenues 35 per cent higher and helped it narrow losses in the second quarter.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US aircraft maker reported a net loss of $612mn for the
three months to the end of June, down from $1.44bn a year earlier, on revenue
of $22.7bn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Analysts polled by LSEG had expected a loss of $631mn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Boeing also reported better than expected free cash outflow
of $200mn in the second quarter, down from $4.3bn in the same period a year
earlier. The company burned through more than $14bn in cash in 2024 after a
turbulent year marked by a damaging workforce strike and the blowout of a door
panel on an Alaska Airlines jet mid-flight that renewed questions over the
quality of its manufacturing.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a memo to staff yesterday, Kelly Ortberg, Boeing’s chief
executive, said the group was “ahead” of where he expected in stabilising its
business. Ortberg took the helm last August and was tasked with coordinating
Boeing’s overhaul after safety and manufacturing crises, which began with the
Indonesia Lion Air 737 Max crash in 2018.</p><p class="MsoNormal">‘We are moving in the right direction and are ahead of where
I thought we would be in our recovery.’</p><p class="MsoNormal">The crisis at the company intensified last year when
regulators imposed a production cap on its 737 Max following the Alaska
Airlines incident in January. Last month’s Air India crash involving a Boeing
787-8 aircraft — the cause of which is not yet known — has also cast a shadow
over its recovery plans.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ortberg has made progress in stabilising Boeing’s production
and improving its quality-control processes. He had hailed 2025 as the
company’s “turnaround year” before the Air India crash.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“With the start of the second half of the year, we are
moving in the right direction and ahead of where I thought we would be in our
recovery,” Ortberg said in the message to employees.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Shares in Boeing, which have risen more than 32 per cent
since the start of the year, fell 3.5 per cent in morning trading.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company has delivered some good news for investors in
recent months, including securing its largest-ever wide-body order from Qatar
for up to 210 787 and 777X aircraft. Increased deliveries are vital to Boeing’s
recovery. Ortberg yesterday said the company had delivered 150 commercial jets
in the first quarter and 280 in the first six months of 2025, the most for both
periods since 2018.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Boeing’s defense unit, which recently won a deal to build
the US Air Force’s next-generation fighter, reported an operating profit of
$110mn in the second quarter compared with an operating loss of $913mn in the
same period a year earlier. Ortberg said Boeing had seen “improved performance”
on its fixed-price development programmes.</p></body></html>
