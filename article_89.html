investors? Heathrow airport will this week publish detailed plans for a
privately financed third runway. Rumours and guesstimates run as high as £60bn.
The world’s most expensive airport — a regular airline gripe — should assume
the brace position for an onslaught of headlines and incredulity.</p><p class="MsoNormal">British sensitivity is extremely high when it comes to
infrastructure investment. Between the debacle of the pared-back High Speed
Rail 2 plans, which are now expected to cost £80bn, and the long-running debate
over nationalising Thames Water, whose private owners loaded it with
unsustainable debt, trust is low in the management skills of both officials and
the private sector when it comes to public goods.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Heathrow, whose largest shareholder is French private equity
group Ardian, has already come under fire this month after submitting a
separate £10bn investment proposal to its regulator. Covering plans for the
five years from 2027, Heathrow’s backers would invest £2bn in fresh capital.
Airlines — for which read their customers, mostly — would face a 17 per cent
increase in the average landing charge per passenger over that time. The spend,
Heathrow says, would include a big expansion in terminal space and an increase
in passenger capacity of 10mn, or about 12 per cent from 2025 targets. Airlines
have called the costs excessive.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The numbers making the rounds are big. But not all the
spluttering is justified. Airport expansions don't come cheap. Dallas Fort
Worth last year announced a $9bn upgrade plan, promising a big transformation.
New York’s JFK is in the middle of a $19bn redevelopment, pledging sparkling
new terminals and snazzy streamlined processes. Singapore's Changi airport,
regularly voted the world’s best, is getting a new runway and an additional
terminal for some S$13bn (£8bn).</p><p class="MsoNormal">These plans look less pricey than Heathrow’s, but these
airports are not as constrained by space and the need to build up or tunnel
down.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Heathrow’s investors received their first dividend this year
since the Covid-19 pandemic. The airport has held off confirming further
payouts as it waits for regulatory input on its spending plans. The most
impressive number in its first-half report was that 98 per cent of passengers
spent less than five minutes waiting at security.</p><p class="MsoNormal">No entertaining holiday or business travel stories start
with a saunter through check-in, security and boarding. But airport headlines
don't just have to be about things that go wrong, either. The success of the
cross-London express Elizabeth Line, albeit two decades in the building and
billions over budget, shows big transport projects can still wow for the right
reasons. Would that Heathrow, whether it spends £10bn or multiples of that with
third runway approval, ends up following that example.</p></body></html>
