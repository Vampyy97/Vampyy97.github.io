After the Bell</p><p class="MsoNormal">In Rodney Dangerfield's 1986 comedy <i>Back to School</i>,
a wealthy tycoon enrols at his son's university and treats academia like just
another business deal. He throws epic parties and hires experts to do his
coursework, such as paying Kurt Vonnegut to ghostwrite a paper on Kurt
Vonnegut. The film's humour lies in the clash between real-world business
practices and academic standards. The professor, for example, gives the
Vonnegut essay an "F", saying it failed to understand the author's
work.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Life sometimes imitates art. While many retiring financiers
pursue board seats or advisory roles, others return to the classroom, searching
for intellectual renewal or maybe just a do-over of their wayward youth.</p><p class="MsoNormal">On paper, it sounds idyllic: trading the conference room for
the seminar room, PowerPoint for Plutarch. Academia promises liberation from
client demands, "stretch" revenue targets and quarterly reviews. It
is in part later-life reinvention and in part nostalgia for the carefree
student life that slipped by too quickly - now revisited with the wisdom of
experience but without the old anxieties about grades and exams.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The reality is often less romantic. What thrilled you at 20
can feel trivial or impractically abstract at 55. Returning to university often
reveals how much you have changed - and how little academia has.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I've spoken to several former colleagues and competitors who
attempted this late-career pivot. The results have been mixed. One ex-banker
enrolled in a computer science master's programme, hoping to co-found an
artificial intelligence venture with a professor, who turned out to have no
commercial acumen. Another began a PhD in economics but left after getting a
master's, disillusioned by departmental turf wars and the asphyxiating
narrowness of academic research. A third did finish a doctorate in anthropology,
enjoying the fieldwork more than the coursework and finding the dissertation a
tedious slog to write.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The adjustment to academic life can be jarring. After years
in senior roles, it is not easy to take instruction from lecturers who may be
decades younger. Academic theories often struggle to account for the messy
ambiguity of real-world business. Where once you wrote one-page memos and used
bullet points in presentations, you're now expected to produce dense,
citation-heavy prose. Concise writing and presentational fluency can come
across as shallow or glib in scholarly settings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The generational gap adds friction. Group projects with
classmates 30 years younger can test your patience. Their certainty may strike
you as naive and dogmatic; you've seen enough market cycles to know how few
things are absolute. But then again, you were once as confidently opinionated
as they are.</p><p class="MsoNormal">And that's the issue. You can't go back because you're no
longer who you were. You're more seasoned, more sceptical. You want to cut to
the point and see the practical application.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Logistics complicate things further. Relocating for school
was simple in your late teens or early twenties. At 55 or 60, with a family,
ageing parents, or other obligations, it's not. It's also hard to justify
uprooting your life for a course that may offer few post-graduation
opportunities.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Indeed, the vision of academia as a fresh career springboard
rarely survives contact with reality. The jobs market does not clamor for
58-year-old graduates with shiny new degrees in biomechanical ethics or
advanced numismatics. A few former financiers I know have secured prestigious
consulting or policy roles but they are outliers. Ageism remains the last
"condonable prejudice" in hiring.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For some, this doesn't matter. They're not seeking a career
reboot but something more profound - the chance to discover fresh direction and
purpose and to have a positive social impact. Programmes such as Harvard's
Advanced Leadership Initiative and Stanford's Distinguished Careers Institute
cater to this urge, offering senior professionals a curated curriculum that
combines coursework, networking and bespoke events.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Friends who have attended rave about them. But with tuition
costs in the region of $70,000, no formal degree and a small number of learning
fellows, they are niche offerings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Not everyone returns as a student. A former European
business school dean told me many ex-bankers apply to teach. Some land adjunct
roles - but full-time posts are rare because accreditation rules require a high
proportion of PhDs on the faculty. The appeal is not the modest pay but the
chance to mentor, rather than manage.</p><p class="MsoNormal">One former banker I know, now a tenured B-school professor,
keeps 1980s deals "tombstones" - small plaques that commemorate a big
transaction, such as a merger or IPO on his campus office bookshelf and says
students appreciate hearing the war stories.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Retiring bankers can revisit the classroom but not the
person they were when they first walked in. You don't get a second youth, just
a new perspective shaped by experience. And as Dangerfield's character learns,
hiring Vonnegut isn't the same as understanding him.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The writer is a former global head of equity capital markets
at Bank of America and is now a managing director at Seda Experts.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
