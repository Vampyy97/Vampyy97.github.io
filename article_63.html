last quarter as it was hit by losses from its stake in Air India, the carrier
embroiled in India's worst aviation disaster in three decades.<br/>
Net profits at Singapore's national carrier fell from S$266mn ($207mn) to
S$186mn compared with the same period last year, the group reported yesterday.
It said its losses from associated companies, "notably from Air India's
financial results", were S$122mn for the three months to the end of June.<br/>
Singapore Airlines' revenue rose 1.5 per cent to S$4.8bn in the quarter, which
the group said showed demand for flights remained strong despite economic and
geopolitical uncertainties.<br/>
More than 240 passengers and crew died when an Air India flight bound for
London crashed shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad last month, leaving a
sole survivor.<br/>
Global focus has shifted to the roles of the Air India pilots after media
reports that the captain may have turned off the plane's fuel switches shortly
after take-off. However, earlier this month, India's Air Accident Investigation
Bureau warned foreign media against "irresponsible" speculation about
the causes of the disaster as the probe continued.<br/>
Singapore Airlines acquired a 25 per cent stake in Air India last year after
its joint venture with Tata Sons was absorbed in a merger. Tata had bought Air
India out of state ownership in 2022.<br/>
This month, Tata reported that privately held Air India registered an annual
loss of Rs108.59bn ($1.25bn) in the year to the end of March 2025, the first
time it had published financial details since the full merger with its sister
airlines.<br/>
Singapore Airlines said it was committed to its Indian business.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
