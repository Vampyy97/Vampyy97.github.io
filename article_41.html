July 21) captures the excitement in Europe at the opportunity to leverage
President Donald Trump’s apparent shift towards supplying Ukraine with more US
munitions. But expectations on both sides of the Atlantic should be tempered by
reality.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a single recent Russian strike on July 9, Ukraine was
attacked with 728 Shahed-style drones, seven cruise missiles, and six ballistic
missiles. The US currently produces just about 600 Patriot interceptor missiles
per year — fewer than were needed to defend against that single attack if the
system was relied on exclusively. There is no surge capacity left. Expanding
production isn’t a matter of flipping a switch; it’s a years- or even
decades-long process involving labour shortages, strained supply chains, and
complex component bottlenecks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Worse, Ukraine is only one of the regions clamouring for
these munitions. US forces require interceptors for their own operational needs
in the Middle East and Asia, where the threat from Iranian and Chinese missile
stockpiles remains a significant challenge. At a certain point, transfers will
stop — not because of politics, but because there simply won’t be any missiles
left to send regardless of who’s paying for them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ukraine is developing its own drone interceptors and
receiving other systems from allies, which helps alleviate over-reliance on
limited US supplies. But these can’t compensate for the scale and reliability
of US platforms.</p><p class="MsoNormal">If Europe wants to chart a long-term path to stability, it
must reckon with these hard limits. America is overextended in an increasingly
unstable world, and its capacity to support this war is not infinite.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Robert Clarke<br/>
