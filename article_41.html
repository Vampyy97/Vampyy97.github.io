23), Edward Luce remarked that “the Vatican is no trading entity”. While modest
in scale, its trading activity is evidently material enough for the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association to recently issue a netting
memo on contracts entered into within Vatican jurisdiction. Such opinions
typically assess the enforceability of derivatives close-out provisions in the
event of default or insolvency. One must assume that appropriate theological consideration
was given to any “Act of God” clauses.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ciaran McGonagle<br/>
