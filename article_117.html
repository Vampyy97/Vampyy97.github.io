amid fiscal strains</h2><p class="MsoNormal">African nation is pushing for ‘full control’ of Anglo’s
diamond unit but analysts say it lacks the funds<br/>
CAMILLA HODGSON AND JOSEPH COTTERILL — LONDON<br/>
MONICA MARK — JOHANNESBURG</p><p class="MsoNormal">When De Beers found diamonds in Botswana in 1967, it set a
newly independent nation on a course to become one of Africa’s wealthiest
countries. Almost 60 years later, a ferocious attack by Botswana’s government
on Anglo American’s sale of one of the world’s most valuable diamond producers
has shown just how quickly that long relationship has hit the rocks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The country’s mining minister told the Financial Times last
week that President Duma Boko was serious about turning Botswana's 15 per cent
stake in De Beers into “full control over this strategic national asset”, as
tensions rise during the worst slump in the diamond market in decades.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Boko said in a fiery July speech that Botswana, the source
of most of De Beers’ diamonds and reliant on the stones for most of its
exports, was “broke”, adding the company was “not doing its job. Maybe we
should take over and sell them ourselves”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Days before an Anglo deadline for initial bids for its 85
per cent stake, potential buyers are wondering if Botswana really could mount a
takeover, or if it is bluster from a government that swept to power on populist
promises but is now strapped for cash.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Its financial strains meant the prospect of Botswana's
government acquiring De Beers “seems far-fetched and improbable”, said Kieron
Hodgson, an analyst at Peel Hunt.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Botswana would have pre-emption rights in a sale as an
existing shareholder, but would need to raise funds to finance a takeover,
given pressure on its foreign currency reserves, which stood at $3.5bn in May,
down from $4.8bn a year earlier according to the Bank of Botswana.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Anglo is under pressure to offload De Beers quickly, as part
of restructuring promised after it fought off a £39bn hostile takeover bid from
rival BHP last year. Boko’s broadside has “ruffled a few feathers and will do
no good in attracting funding partners” for other bids, said one industry
expert.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Boko, elected last year, is the country’s first president to
come from outside the Botswana Democratic Party, which had governed since the
country’s independence in 1966. The BDP had steered regular negotiations with
De Beers over stones produced through their 50-50 joint venture, Debswana, but
relations soured in 2023, as a downturn in the global diamond market hit prices
and production.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Just before he was voted out last year, Boko’s predecessor
Mokgweetsi Masisi accused De Beers of having “short-changed” the country,
before agreeing a new 10-year sales deal that let Botswana retain more Debswana
output to sell via a state-owned company.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The latest rhetoric from Boko “might be a negotiating tactic
— you say something on the extreme and then try to negotiate it to the centre,”
Ronak Gopaldas, director at Signal Risk, a consultancy, said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">People familiar with the sale process said two former De
Beers bosses, Gareth Penny and Bruce Cleaver, were among those drawing up
offers for the unit, whose value Anglo has written down twice in the past two
years to $4.9bn, around $2bn of which is inventory. More than 10 parties have
expressed interest in the unit, according to another individual with knowledge
of the sale, including some of the buyers of rough diamonds from De Beers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Competition from lab-grown alternatives and a slump in
demand in markets including China and the US meant De Beers’ revenues last year
were just half of what they were in 2022. Meanwhile, the group’s production in
Botswana in the three months to June fell by 44 per cent year on year to 2.7mn
carats.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Penny has hired Standard Chartered bank and is pulling
together a bid based on restoring the appeal of natural diamonds and spending
more on marketing, according to a person familiar with the matter. Penny and
Cleaver declined to comment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For Anglo a sale price of about $1bn “would be a result,”
said Hodgson. The value of the diamond stocks was hard to estimate, he added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Paul Zimnisky, an independent diamond analyst, said it would
be a “mistake” for Anglo to sell De Beers “at a deep discount in the midst of
the diamond market lull”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Anglo has said it is pursuing a “dual track” approach to the
De Beers disposal, preparing for a potential initial public offering if it does
not receive strong enough bids from buyers. The group has said the process
could stretch into next year and that “we are of course engaging the government
of the Republic of Botswana on a regular basis.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Since Anglo had also found buyers for coal, nickel and
platinum businesses as part of its restructuring, “I don’t see the rush to
unload De Beers for well under book value,” said Zimnisky.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company could “afford to wait a couple more years in
order to get a fair price”, he said, adding that Anglo may be cautious about
pricing since it spun off its platinum business “right before platinum prices
rallied to the highest level in a decade”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Even before Boko’s latest comments, Botswana’s government
had said it wanted to increase its 15 per cent stake in the company. But it has
declined to do so in the past because of fiscal concerns.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In 2011, a need to balance the budget meant that the country
did not exercise pre-emption rights to raise its shareholding when the
Oppenheimer family, which had owned part of De Beers since 1926, decided to
sell its 40 per cent stake, enabling Anglo to build its current position.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“That logic of 2011 still holds — but it holds even more
now. The Botswana government is not as liquid as it was,” said a person with
knowledge of past discussions on the stake.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Botswana recently hired a Swiss private bank, CBH, to advise
it on the De Beers sale, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
CBH declined to comment and Botswana did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Another person familiar with official thinking said there
was “no consolidated view within the government,” adding that other options
also included leaning on De Beers to allow prices to soften in order to boost
demand, or to give more supply to the state’s own seller.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The view coming out of the presidency is ... we should just
sell [more diamonds from the stockpile],” the person added. But officials in
the ministry of minerals were “not so keen” on such a strategy, he said.</p></body></html>
