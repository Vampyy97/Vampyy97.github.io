Montmartre</h2><p class="MsoNormal">Under a light drizzle, the peloton zoomed up the steep,
treacherous stretch of Montmartre’s cobblestone streets in the last stage of
the Tour de France on Sunday — a postcard-perfect finish to the popular
sporting event, won this year for the fourth time by the Slovenian Tadej
Pogacar.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Fans packed Rue Lepic, adding yet another page to the
history of a key artery that has long symbolised the artistic, rebellious
spirit of Montmartre, a neighbourhood which was once a windmill-dotted village
considered too far from central Paris to bother with.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Inspired by the cycling event at the Paris Olympics last
summer, the race organisers added the circuit up Rue Lepic and around the
basilica of Sacré-Coeur to spice up the usual closing sprint along the
Champs-Elysées.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It is hard to be grouchy about all this when the spectacle
reminds one of how stunning Paris can be. And yet, some residents of Montmartre
fear that this reconfigured final étape of the tour will only fuel the rampant
tourism that has transformed their neighbourhood into a background for people's
social media posts. “Tourists come to consume the place, take a few photos, and
rush off,” says Anne Renaudie, longtime resident and member of a group
advocating for the livability of the neighbourhood. “They treat Montmartre like
an amusement park.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Renaudie is part of a burgeoning movement of Montmartre
residents pressuring the city to preserve their quality of life instead of
chasing tourist dollars. While critics dismiss such complaints as predictable
from those who live in an area where real estate prices are among the city’s
highest, the residents do have a point.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The growing flows of visitors to Montmartre have already had
ripple effects: boulangeries being replaced by high-end clothing stores, tour
buses clogging narrow streets, and schools closing as families get priced out
by Airbnb. The area’s morphing into a strip of souvenir shops holds a certain
irony given it was once a bastion of socialist radicalism under the Paris
Commune.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I live only a 10-minute walk from Sacré-Coeur but in my
neighbourhood, charm gives way to grit as the entrenched problems of noise,
dirtiness and crime reappear.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some tourists end up there, perhaps tricked by the physical
proximity to Montmartre or attracted by lower prices. I often wonder if they
regret not staying amid the ersatz old Paris bistros and accordionists playing
Edith Piaf’s “La Vie en Rose”. Is the historical caricature better or today’s
flawed reality?</p><p class="MsoNormal">The negative consequences for people who live in tourist
hotspots are obvious, as shown by protests in recent years from Barcelona to
Venice. But there seems to be little way to curb arrivals, save perhaps for the
whole thing to become so unpleasant that the tourists just stop coming.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Cities have become over-reliant on tourism revenues.
Parisian property owners cannot resist the higher yields earned from short-term
rentals, especially since the city has strict rent controls.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Then there is the Netflix effect.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While the 2001 movie <i>Amélie</i> brought people
to Montmartre, Netflix has turbocharged tourist flows. The picturesque Maison
Rose restaurant, once frequented by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali, is now met
with a constant stream of <i>Emily in Paris</i> fans who stop here to
mark where the eccentrically dressed Emily laments having to close her social
media accounts. A bakery featured in the animated kids’ show <i>Miraculous</i> has
also become submerged.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some canny marketers will probably soon offer tours to
capitalise on the new addition to the Tour de France. In fact, the race has
always been symbiotic with tourism, which was founded in 1903 by a sports
newspaper seeking to increase sales. By broadcasting the country’s most
beautiful landscapes to a global audience, the event has become a powerful
promotion tool, so much so that local governments still pay for the tour to
loop through their towns.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Mayors in lesser-known corners of France do not need to
worry about overtourism, but Montmartre surely needs no more promotion. It
might be time to turn the cameras off, whether they belong to the Tour de
France, Netflix or TikTok.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="mailto:leila.abboud@ft.com" target="_blank">leila.abboud@ft.com</a></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
