along their shared border that has killed more than 30 people and displaced
about 300,000 in recent days.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The pact, due to come into effect last night, was sealed by
leaders of the two neighbouring south-east Asian nations at talks in Malaysia
held as their governments traded accusations of firing into each other's
territory for a fifth day. US President Donald Trump had warned he would
terminate trade talks with both nations if they did not stop fighting.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia’s prime minister and rotating chair
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, unveiled the pact in Kuala
Lumpur, flanked by the Cambodian and Thai leaders. “Prime Minister Hun Manet
and acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai have expressed their positions
and willingness for immediate ceasefire, and [a] return to normalcy,” Anwar
told a news briefing. The Malaysian prime minister added Trump had “been in
contact” with both countries.</p><p class="MsoNormal">He said Thailand and Cambodia had agreed to a meeting of
their regional military leaders today, to be followed by a meeting of defence
attaches.</p><p class="MsoNormal">They would also convene a gathering of the General Border
Committee, a bilateral military group, on August 4.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed credit
for the ceasefire and said he had called the Thai and Cambodian leaders. “I
have instructed my Trade Team to restart negotiations on Trade,” Trump wrote.
“I have now ended many Wars in just six months — I am proud to be the President
of PEACE!”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Malaysian leader said China, which has friendly
relations with both Cambodia and Thailand, had kept in “close contact” with
them and Malaysia during efforts to broker a ceasefire.</p><p class="MsoNormal">China’s foreign ministry said yesterday it was “deeply
saddened” by the casualties caused and that it intended to “play a constructive
role in promoting a ceasefire and ending the conflict”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hun Manet said he hoped to stop immediately the fighting,
which had “cost many lives” and created 140,000 refugees in Cambodia and
160,000 in Thailand. Phumtham thanked Anwar, Trump and China for helping to
broker an outcome that reflected “Thailand’s desire for a peaceful resolution”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Fighting broke out last week amid rising tensions between
Thailand, a US treaty ally, and Cambodia over a long running and emotive border
dispute. The two sides accused each other of targeting civilian areas.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Earlier yesterday, they continued to exchange fire. Cambodia
claimed Thailand had fired first after 3am on Monday. Thailand said it had been
attacked, and fired back to defend itself and prevent an “incursion into
strategic terrain”. It dismissed Cambodia’s claim its forces had used chemical
weapons as “groundless”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Cambodia had very little option but to secure a ceasefire,”
said Virak Ou, founder of Future Forum, a Phnom Penh-based think-tank. “The US
is the biggest market for Cambodian exports, so any trade deal with the US will
have broad implications for the economy for years to come.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Additional reporting by Wenjie Ding</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
