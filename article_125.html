rally</h2><p class="MsoNormal">KAREN WARD — Markets Insight</p><p class="MsoNormal">When I made the case earlier this year that 2025 would be a
good one for European stocks and that they were likely to outperform their US
peers, not many investors were responsive to the idea.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The foundations of my argument were that Europe was
unleashing a heady cocktail of monetary, fiscal and regulatory easing. But
there was pushback against this, unsurprisingly given the dismal performance of
European stocks over the past decade relative to their US counterparts. There
have been three areas of questioning.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The first relates to scepticism about Europe’s innate
ability to increase corporate earnings. Investors would cite the region’s
fragmented capital markets and inflexible labour markets or any of the other
challenges listed in the recent competitiveness report by former Italian prime
minister Mario Draghi. They would argue that Europe's economy is structurally
impaired, incapable of delivering robust earnings growth.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While fixing these issues would do the region good,
historically they haven’t stopped European companies delivering solid
profitability. Many investors were surprised when I mentioned that in the
post-dotcom bubble, pre-financial crisis period, most of the sectors in the
MSCI EMU benchmark produced stronger earnings growth than their S&amp;P 500
counterparts.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Indeed, the earnings of MSCI EMU companies grew 29 per cent
annualised compared with 13 per cent for S&amp;P 500 companies over the same
period.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But what about tech, I often hear. The second pushback from
sceptical investors is that European markets do not have those tech giants
changing the world with artificial intelligence.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Europe does lag behind the US as an originator of
cutting-edge technologies. However, European companies will nonetheless be key
deployers of these technologies and beneficiaries of them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">If European companies don't rush to buy these products, then
I would be questioning the valuations of the US tech companies themselves.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Finally, I’m often told that the euro’s appreciation will
prevent growth in European corporate earnings. For European exporters, a
stronger euro might weigh on their euro-denominated profits. In addition, the
EU-US trade agreement — while better than no deal — still entails higher trade
frictions.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However, the economic recovery in Europe will probably be
driven by domestic factors such as household consumption, which is rising as
lower interest rates work to bring down still-elevated savings rates.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Additionally, Europe’s financial companies will be a key
driver of the region’s profitability as its banks now sit on ample capital and
can deploy it at more normal levels of interest rates.</p><p class="MsoNormal">History also shows that it’s a fallacy that euro
appreciation necessarily weighs on European markets. In fact, euro appreciation
and European equity outperformance often go hand in hand.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Looking once again at the post-dotcom, pre-financial crisis
period, MSCI EMU outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by an annualised 5.2 percentage
points in local currency terms. At the same time, the euro appreciated
meaningfully by about 40 per cent against the dollar.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For a euro-based investor, this meant that MSCI EMU’s
outperformance reached a staggering 9.8 percentage points annualised.
Similarly, during another period of European outperformance in the mid- to
late-1980s, both the Deutschemark and the French franc appreciated versus the
dollar.</p><p class="MsoNormal">More investors are warming to the idea that European stocks
could be turning a corner. But they are also worried they may have missed the
move.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I would argue this is not the case. European equities do not
yet price in the sustainability and breadth of earnings growth we should see in
coming years.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Analysts expect MSCI EMU companies to deliver a modest 8 per
cent earnings growth over the next year with investors paying just 14 times
that earnings growth to own the benchmark. Compare that with the US, where
S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to grow 12 per cent over the next 12 months
and where investors must pay 22 times those earnings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Indeed, every MSCI EMU sector still trades at a larger than
average discount to its US counterpart.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Even after the gains of recent months, Europe’s lost decade
continues to weigh on investors’ perception of the region. In my opinion, the
potential for significant investor reappraisal only strengthens the case for
European outperformance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Karen Ward is chief market strategist for Europe, Middle
