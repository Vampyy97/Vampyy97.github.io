upstarts</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="486" src="FT_files/image067.png" width="369"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">Just after he took over Twitter, Elon Musk ended a practice
where the social network shared user data for free with developers at other
companies who relied on this Twitter “graph” to build their own apps. Such
gratis sharing of so-called application programming interfaces (APIs) was
thought to help build a stronger ecosystem that would in the long run benefit
Twitter itself.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Musk, however, concluded Twitter needed the short-term money
more, and started selling its data.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US banking industry has now taken a Musk-like posture.
JPMorgan plans to sell APIs that it previously provided for free, both to data
aggregators and directly to upstart... fintechs. Some fintechs have reportedly
received invoices as high as 60 to 100 per cent of annual revenue.</p><p class="MsoNormal">JPMorgan’s move comes amid a change in the regulatory
environment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Biden administration had sought to implement a rule
making banks share their data for free, a policy that exists around the world.
US President Donald Trump has recently abandoned a lawsuit to protect that
concept from a challenge. But the politics are complicated: Trump’s supporters
in Silicon Valley are sceptical about the traditional banking industry and are
creating new financial services using “open banking”, where existing banks
provide their customer data.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Powerful incumbents are understandably wary about giving up
the building blocks of their power. The banks reckon that providing customer
data to those who request it creates substantial costs that they would
ultimately have to pass on to customers. More importantly, giving away their
APIs for free has led to overconsumption. Fixing a price may encourage a more
efficient approach.</p><p class="MsoNormal">On the flipside, competition in financial services has
created new companies outside the traditional banking sector and the worry is
that innovation could now be chilled.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A decade ago, the likes of Netflix argued for “net
neutrality” where those companies that owned the internet pipes could not
choose to throttle bandwidth for content providers who did not want to pay an
extra toll.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Banking customer data similarly is either social
infrastructure or a private trade secret, but the ultimate determination is
made by those who hold political power.</p><p class="MsoNormal">JPMorgan has a market capitalisation of $800bn but has
struggled at times with what posture is needed to take on challengers. It has
sometimes found that co-operation on commercial terms can be advantageous to
both sides.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Expect the banks and start-ups to find a deal, however
grudging, that works.</p></body></html>
