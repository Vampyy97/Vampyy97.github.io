quarter as luxury decline persists</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="562" src="FT_files/image054.png" width="549"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">ADRIENNE KLASA — PARIS</p><p class="MsoNormal">Gucci sales plunged again in Kering’s most recent quarter,
underlining the scale of the challenge facing the French luxury group’s new
chief executive Luca de Meo.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Comparable revenues at Gucci fell 25 per cent to €1.46bn in
the second quarter compared with the same period in 2024. That was a similar
decline to the first quarter and in line with expectations from analysts
compiled by Visible Alpha.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Gucci accounts for about half of Kering’s sales and
two-thirds of operating profits. A turnaround at the brand has stalled and
performance across the rest of the group has also deteriorated amid a global
slowdown in luxury demand. Sales at Yves Saint Laurent, the second-largest
brand, fell 10 per cent in the quarter.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Though the numbers we are reporting remain well below our
potential, we are certain that our comprehensive efforts of the past two years
have set healthy foundations for the next stages in Kering’s development,” said
Francois-Henri Pinault, chair and chief executive.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Chief financial officer Armelle Poulou said Gucci sales
improved among North American shoppers, while Bottega Veneta and the eyewear
division rose by single digits in the period.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Operating income in the first half fell 39 per cent to
€969mn, dragged down by a decline of more than 50 per cent at Gucci. Sales in
every major region were down by double digits in the quarter to €3.7bn — a 15
per cent organic decline that was in line with expectations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">De Meo, who is credited with turning around carmaker Renault
and joins in September, will need to improve Kering’s performance, tackle its
mounting debt and reconfigure its management, said Bernstein analyst Luca
Solca. The Paris-based group’s net debt hit €10.5bn in 2024, having more than
quadrupled since 2022.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The increase in Kering’s debt level [has] raised investors’
concerns” following a series of acquisitions and real estate deals, analysts at
HSBC said ahead of yesterday’s results, especially in light of last year’s 50
per cent decline in earnings before interest and tax, which are expected to
“remain under pressure in 2025.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">De Meo is set to take over from Pinault, the scion of
Kering’s controlling family, who has been both chief executive and chair since
2005. Pinault will remain as chair.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kering’s fortunes have deteriorated since Gucci started to
fall out of favour four years ago. In March, shares fell more than 10 per cent
in one day as investors reacted badly to the appointment of Balenciaga designer
Demna Gvasalia to lead the brand, replacing Sabato De Sarno.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
