how to regulate one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency markets amid fears
that frenzied demand for stablecoins is stoking capital outflows.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The ruling party has proposed legislation allowing companies
with as little as Won500mn ($360,000) in equity capital to issue won-based
stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency backed by fiat money holdings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But the central bank is concerned that allowing their
issuance could spark massive capital outflows that would hamper its ability to
respond to foreign exchange crises such as the one that swept across Asia in
1997. That has put the Bank of Korea at odds with the government.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“If we allow non-banks to issue stablecoins, this will cause
big chaos like in the 19th century when currencies issued by the private sector
flooded [the market],” Bank of Korea governor Rhee Chang-yong said this month,
referring to the US “free banking” era when hundreds of small banks were
allowed to issue their own notes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Rhee has instead argued that only commercial banks be
allowed to issue stablecoins under strict oversight, triggering frustration
among some ruling party lawmakers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Stablecoins are surging like a tsunami but we are fighting
over who will run a small boat in the face of a tsunami,” Min Byung-duk, the
lawmaker who proposed the legislation, said in a presentation at the National
Assembly last week.</p><p class="MsoNormal">About a third of South Korea’s 52mn people invest in digital
assets, making it one of the world’s most vibrant crypto markets. Retail
investors’ digital assets totalled more than $70bn at the end of last year,
according to the central bank.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Dollar-backed stablecoins are particularly popular, with
more than $19bn of the asset taken out of the country in the first quarter of
this year, according to regulatory data. Most investors use them to buy crypto
on overseas exchanges, where digital assets are often cheaper because of
regulatory barriers and higher demand relative to supply in South Korea,
according to a survey by Seoul-based investment group Hashed Ventures.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Stablecoins can facilitate capital outflows because
investors can buy them with won at local crypto exchanges and move the coins to
digital wallets, where they can be easily converted to dollars abroad.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The outflows have so concerned the Bank of Korea that last
month it lifted a 14-year ban on domestic institutional purchases of onshore
foreign-currency bonds in order to draw in offsetting inflows.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The ruling party believes that won-backed stablecoins can
ensure that money stays in the country. Min has urged lawmakers to set up a
regulatory framework for stablecoins as soon as possible, especially after the
US Congress passed a law doing the same.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“This is our last chance to take some portion of the market,
even if we can’t outsmart dollar stablecoins as a settlement tool,” said Min.
“Speed is the key.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Bank of Korea has cautioned that won-backed stablecoins
can still accelerate outflows because they can be easily converted to
dollar-backed ones. But even it has had to acknowledge growing demand for the
assets. Last month it suspended plans to roll out a central bank digital
currency.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Analysts said that it was unlikely to be used widely if the
private sector were to issue won-backed stablecoins and banks were reluctant to
shoulder the costs of the CBDC, according to people close to the companies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Companies have already started working on stablecoins,
anticipating that the legislation will pass. Eight commercial banks are jointly
working on a won-backed stablecoin with a target launch date of 2026, while
Upbit, the country’s biggest crypto exchange, and payments company Naver Pay
are collaborating on one as well.</p></body></html>
