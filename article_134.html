unintended consequences. Here are just three examples, all of which undermine
Ofcom’s attempts to make the internet safer for children.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Tim Bradshaw’s article highlights the VPN workaround for
people wishing to avoid age restrictions (Report, July 28).</p><p class="MsoNormal">The spike in VPN app downloads to which the article refers
is a near-real-time reaction to the age verification measures that Ofcom has
made mandatory. App downloads are measurable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A second unintended consequence is that VPNs could lead
young people to worse areas of the internet than those they access without a
VPN. This is probably unobservable; it’s dark.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A third unintended consequence may take longer to emerge.
Ofcom’s guidance lists seven possible ways in which age can be verified. The
list is not exhaustive and leaves service providers to determine the technical
execution of the checks. Several of the checks involve uploading documents or
facial recognition. We should then ask ourselves the next questions in the
security sequence: how are these images subsequently processed and stored? In
order to demonstrate compliance, might the records be stored for a considerable
time?</p><p class="MsoNormal">In digital security, we refer to attack surfaces. The name
of the game with security is to minimise the attack surface. Has Ofcom
inadvertently expanded the UK population’s attack surface?</p><p class="MsoNormal">Michael Hobbs<br/>
