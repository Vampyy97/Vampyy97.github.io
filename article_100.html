that Donald Trump’s trade war will do less damage to the world economy than
feared, with a weaker dollar cushioning the impact of tariffs on US trading
partners.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The fund’s updated World Economic Outlook shows that global
growth is expected to be 3 per cent this year and 3.1 per cent in 2026, up from
projections published in April of 2.8 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The two largest economies — the US and China — both received
upgrades. The IMF forecast the UK would be the third fastest-growing G7 economy
this year and next, after the US and Canada.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF chief economist, told the
Financial Times that he saw a “tenuous resilience” in the global economy
despite the chaotic rollout of steep tariffs on US trading partners in recent
months. He added that growth was less affected because many of the levies were
ultimately not as severe as originally planned.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“At the time of the April forecast we had an effective
tariff rate on [imports into the US] of 24 per cent. We're now looking at an
effective tariff rate of 17 per cent. While 17 is still much higher than where
we were in January, there’s been some easing of the tariff pressure.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Companies “frontloading” imports ahead of the implementation
of the trade levies had boosted growth so far in 2025, the IMF said, warning
that this stockpiling created “exposures that could amplify the impact of any
potential negative shocks.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Gourinchas said that weakness in the US dollar had helped to
prop up the world economy. The currency has fallen almost 9 per cent this year
against a basket of peers, including the euro and the pound, on concerns over
the trade war as well as the Federal Reserve's independence.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Since many foreign companies and emerging market economies
have debt denominated in the dollar, depreciation makes that debt cheaper to
service.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The net effect right now is that it’s providing a little
bit of buoyancy to the global economy by easing global financial conditions,”
Gourinchas said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The more optimistic forecast from the IMF marks a shift from
its WEO in April, in which it warned that the trade war risked pushing the
global economy into a “significant slowdown.” However, the forecast would still
mark a slowdown from 2024's global economic growth of 3.3 per cent. The average
growth rate before the pandemic was 3.7 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which was signed into
law on July 4, might help spur growth, the IMF indicated that the US
president’s attacks on the Fed’s freedom to set interest rates could prove
damaging.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The evidence on this is overwhelming,” Gourinchas said,
without mentioning the US central bank. “[Undermining the Fed’s independence]
will introduce macroeconomic, monetary and financial volatility. It’s an asset
that is very important to preserve.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
