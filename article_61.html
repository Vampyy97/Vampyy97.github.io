for its data</h2><p class="MsoNormal">Start-ups say bank's move to end free access to customer
information is a thinly disguised ploy to kill competition<br/>

NEW YORK</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img height="342" src="FT_files/image032.jpg" width="602"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">JPMorgan Chase has alarmed financial technology start-ups
with plans to charge them to access its customer data, a move that could
endanger their business models and is seen by some as chief executive Jamie
Dimon's attempt to crush nascent competitors.</p><p class="MsoNormal">At the end of June, the largest US bank by assets sent out
price sheets to start-ups that have long relied on free access to bank consumer
data to power other financial services. This includes data aggregators, such as
Plaid, that have grown in the past decade thanks to this free data-sharing
model.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The dispute highlights the interconnected nature of banks
and non-bank companies in providing financial services in a digital world, and
the cost of sharing the data between the two sides. But the proposed charges by
JPMorgan have triggered outrage from smaller fintech players.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Many of them argue that their business models would not be
able to withstand the steep fees and that those that will would be forced to
pass down significant costs to consumers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Steve Boms, executive director of the Financial Data and
Technology Association, a trade group representing about 30 aggregators and
fintech companies, said that JPMorgan's action was a "pure and
simple" attempt to kill competition that would "put third parties out
of business altogether".</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Across all the companies that received the notices,
the cost of just accessing Chase data is somewhere from 60 percent and in some
cases well over 100 percent of their annual revenue for the year," said
Boms, whose group's members include Plaid, Fiserv and Intuit. "Just from
one bank."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Chase's fees could take effect as early as the start of
September, though the bank is in talks with the various companies that could
alter the timeline and the amounts charged.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"We have explicitly reserved the right to charge a fee
for data access since day one of our agreements," a JPMorgan spokesperson
said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Under rules finalised by the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau during former US president Joe Biden's administration, banks would be
prohibited from charging third parties for access to consumer data. However,
the gutting of the regulator by the Trump administration has led to this rule
being changed, opening the door for banks to set their own fees.</p><p class="MsoNormal">JPMorgan's argument is that banks have spent millions of
dollars to build APIs, or application programming interfaces, that allow
fintechs safely to access customer data. The bank says that of the 2bn monthly
API requests it receives from aggregators, about 90 per cent are unrelated to a
customer using a fintech service.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Having a charging structure will ensure that data is
provided only when customers request it, and that data middlemen are fostering
a safe, secure data ecosystem that we built and maintain—and that their entire
industry was built on," a bank spokesperson said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Inside the bank, there is a view that these costs and
requests will only significantly increase in the years ahead. The Bank Policy
Institute, an industry lobby group, argued earlier this month that "data
sharing comes at a cost".</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Charging data middlemen responsible for the largest
volume of requests allows banks to cover basic business expenses without
passing those costs on to consumers," the BPI said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">JPMorgan's Dimon has also consistently warned of the threat
of fintechs to banks. In April, the CEO wrote in his annual letter that his
bank needed "to be as nimble as they are and use our skills and
capabilities to stay ahead".</p><p class="MsoNormal">Other banks could follow JPMorgan's lead—Pennsylvania-based
PNC, the ninth-largest US lender by assets, has said it is discussing it.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"I applaud what JP did. I think they're exactly
right," PNC chief executive Bill Demchak told analysts earlier this month.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Financial Technology Association, which represents the
fintechs, has taken its case to the courts calling on them to uphold the CFPB's
revoked rule, which it said "reflects a bipartisan commitment to
modernising how Americans manage their financial lives".</p><p class="MsoNormal">"We've seen the nation's biggest banks really take
advantage of this moment of regulatory uncertainty to consolidate their
position in the market and to crush competition," said Miranda Margowsky,
an FTA spokesperson.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Critics of the fee-charging model also note that the move
would make the US an outlier in explicitly allowing banks to charge for open
banking access.</p><p class="MsoNormal">'We've seen the nation's biggest banks really take advantage
of this moment of regulatory uncertainty'</p><p class="MsoNormal">The data-sharing technology has flourished in jurisdictions
where it is mandated to be largely free, including the UK, Brazil and Sweden.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"It would put us completely the opposite of every other
country with open banking," said Boms.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Fintechs are also seeking to gain political traction by
highlighting the risk that the move could adversely affect the crypto
industry—an area championed by the Trump administration—because crypto
companies also rely on open banking access to move money between bank accounts
and crypto wallets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a letter to US President Donald Trump, trade groups that
included the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council for Innovation urged
him to intervene and reverse the regulator's decision.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump's son Donald Trump Jr and David Sacks, an influential
crypto adviser to the White House, have publicly sided with the fintechs
against JPMorgan on social media platform X.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
