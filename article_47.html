agreed</h2><p class="MsoNormal">The EU and US agreed a trade deal that will hit most
European imports with a 15 per cent tariff and require the bloc to invest
hundreds of billions of euros into American energy products and weapons in
order to avoid a trade war. But though the EU has avoided the 30 per cent
tariff rate threatened by President Donald Trump, it still leaves US tariffs at
their highest level in decades.</p><p class="MsoNormal">What will be covered by tariffs?<br/>
The 15 per cent tariff will cover about 70 per cent of EU exports, including
pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, which had not been subject to levies
before. The rate also applies to cars, which had been subject to a 27.5 per
cent tariff ahead of the deal. This totals about €780bn worth of trade, said
the European Commission. US imports into the EU will not face higher tariffs in
return. Germany, which pushed for low tariffs on cars and pharmaceuticals,
welcomed the deal as “acceptable” under tough negotiating circumstances, said
one official. German economy minister Katherina Reiche said the agreement was
“challenging for our economy” but that it was “important that some sectors have
been excluded”. Officials in France—the EU’s biggest agricultural
producer—digested the impact of opening the market to more US agricultural
products. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou described the accord as capitulation,
saying it was a “dark day” for the bloc.</p><p class="MsoNormal">What about steel and aluminium?<br/>
Trump said on Sunday the US would maintain a 50 per cent tariff on steel and
aluminium imports. EU officials said yesterday the two sides had agreed to a
quota based on historic import levels, above which the 50 per cent rate would
apply. But US officials said while a lower tariff quota was being discussed,
nothing had yet been agreed. “They tried to include steel, and the president
said no, you know, he’s not willing to put steel into this deal. And they
accepted that,” an official said. “There are still a variety of things they can
add to the agreement over time.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Which sectors will have zero tariffs?<br/>
The two sides agreed they would both cut tariffs to zero on about €70bn of
trade. This included “all aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals,
certain generics . . . certain agricultural products, natural resources, and
critical raw materials,” said commission president Ursula von der Leyen. It was
unclear whether wine and spirits would be included in the tariff-free part of
the deal. Negotiations continue. The zero-tariff preferential treatment for the
US could run counter to World Trade Organization rules, trade experts have
warned. “All of these methods are clearly not WTO-compatible, but it would not
be the first case,” said Ignacio Garcia Bercero, a former EU trade official who
led on WTO rules.</p><p class="MsoNormal">What has the EU promised to buy?<br/>
As part of the deal, the EU has pledged to buy $750bn worth of US energy
products, including gas, oil and nuclear fuel, EU officials have said. This
would amount to $250bn per year for the rest of Trump’s term, von der Leyen
said, marking a significant increase in US energy imports by the bloc. In 2024,
the EU imported €375.9bn worth of energy products from all over the world.
Total US energy exports to the EU accounted for about €75bn last year,
according to Eurostat. The commission has also committed to investing $600bn
into the US economy, as well as to undefined amounts of weapons purchases. But
the EU has no legal power to make these pledges, which is why they were “not
legal commitments”, one EU official said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">What happens next?<br/>
The EU and US will issue a joint statement on August 1, which will outline the
main elements of the deal. EU officials expect Trump to then sign an executive
order that will enact the 15 per cent rate. Brussels will then have to
translate the joint statement into legally binding terms, which will require
the backing of a majority of EU countries. If the deal falls apart, which
diplomats have said is unlikely, the EU could still retaliate. Von der Leyen
said she expected the deal to last for the remainder of the Trump presidency.
EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovié said yesterday he hoped the deal would be
a “step to a broader EU-US trade investment agreement in the future</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
