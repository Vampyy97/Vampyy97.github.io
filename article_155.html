policy</h2><p class="MsoNormal">Republicans in the House of Representatives are seeking to
defund the OECD as the Trump administration widens its assault on American
participation in international organisations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">They are pressing ahead with legislation that would end
Washington’s funding for the Paris-based club of mostly rich nations amid anger
over its role in global tax rulemaking, which they argue unfairly targets US
companies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The committee does not support the work of the OECD that
promotes higher tax rates, corporate tax floors and digital tax schemes that
target American taxpayers,” Republicans on the House appropriations committee
wrote in a report recommending the bill.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It comes after G7 countries agreed at Washington’s request
last month to exempt US companies from some parts of the global minimum tax
regime.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In return, the administration withdrew section 899 of US
President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which had threatened to
increase taxes for countries with “discriminatory” levies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The legislation passed the committee stage last week. It
must be passed by the full House, which is on summer recess, and the Senate to
become law.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The threatened funding cuts mark the latest push by the
Trump administration to curb support for the OECD, which received about 18 per
cent of its €235mn 2025 operating budget from Washington. It comes amid a broad
retreat by the US from international organisations, which the administration
views as running contrary to the president’s America First agenda.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Since Trump returned to office, Washington has pulled out of
the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council, the Paris climate
accords and Unesco, the UN’s culture and education agency.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The president has also ordered a review of US participation
in all international organisations. Secretary of state Marco Rubio is due to
deliver a report on the matter to Trump by early August.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The OECD has come in for particular scrutiny. On his first
day in office Trump directed the US to pull out of the group’s global tax deal,
arguing that it “not only allows extraterritorial jurisdiction over American
income but also limits our nation’s ability to enact tax policies that serve
the interests of American businesses and workers.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">But many in his Republican party want to go further. Project
2025, the policy blueprint written by the rightwing Heritage Foundation that
has influenced much of Trump’s second-term agenda, calls for the US to end
funding and withdraw from the organisation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Despite Republicans’ majority in both chambers of Congress,
passing legislation to slash US funding to the body will be an uphill battle.
For any bill to succeed in the Senate it would require the support of at least
seven Democrats in order to bypass the so-called filibuster.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The US is an important founding member of our
organisation,” said OECD secretary-general Mathias Cormann. The body “provides
an important platform to help shape global economic policies and set standards
on critical issues,” he added.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="383" src="FT_files/image073.jpg" width="603"/></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="405" src="FT_files/image074.png" width="582"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">China is increasing its use of "exit bans",
ensnaring Chinese nationals and foreigners alike and deepening concerns about
business travel to the country, according to experts and affected individuals.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This month, Wells Fargo halted work travel to China after
authorities prevented a high-profile American banker from leaving the country.
Just days later, it emerged that a US commerce department employee had been
blocked from leaving as well.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There is no complete record available of exit bans, but data
from China's supreme people's court, which captures a portion of the bans
issued by the judiciary, shows the number of individuals facing travel
restrictions has grown every year since 2018.</p><p class="MsoNormal">John Kamm of The Dui Hua Foundation, which tracks Chinese
travel restrictions, attributed the rising cases to increasing tensions between
Beijing and Donald Trump's Washington. US and Chinese negotiators met in
Stockholm this week for two days of talks to extend their tariff truce.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"There is not a single explanation for the wide range
of exit ban cases. It's a growing problem," said Kamm. He said he was
aware of between 30 and 40 US citizens unable to leave China, but added that
figure was almost certainly an underestimate.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Exit bans are often imposed without explanation, leaving
victims navigating an opaque and often hostile system with little guidance or
recourse. Many people only discover they have been targeted by a ban when
trying to leave the country, Kamm added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">One person, who learned of their exit ban at airport
customs, recalled that a "light turned red and a weird siren rang
out". An officer informed them of the ban and handed over a telephone
number to call for more information. No one ever picked up, they said.</p></body></html>
