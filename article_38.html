vehicle safety requirements for US-made cars is a deeply alarming precedent
(“Washington and Tokyo agree 15% tariff deal”, Report, July 24).</p><p class="MsoNormal">According to reports, Japan will now allow the import of
American-market vehicles without requiring them to meet its domestic safety
testing or standards. In exchange, the US will reduce tariffs on Japanese
vehicle exports.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This is no trade victory — it sets a dangerous precedent:
trading away road safety for short-term political gain. Europe must not follow
suit. As the FT reports, the EU and US are now close to finalising a trade deal
(“Washington and Brussels close in on trade agreement in tariff ‘shakedown’”,
Report, July 24).</p><p class="MsoNormal">If it includes so-called “equivalence” or “mutual
recognition” of vehicles, it would repeat Japan’s mistake — and expose European
road users to lower safety standards.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Back in May, the commission appeared to take a strong line.
The FT reported that Brussels would hold firm on vehicle safety rules despite
US pressure (“EU threatens levy on cars if talks fail”, Report, May 9).</p><p class="MsoNormal">A senior official stated that EU safety standards were not
up for negotiation. The commission must now hold this line — and not give in at
the final hurdle. The safety gap remains stark: EU regulations require
life-saving technologies such as automated emergency braking, intelligent speed
assistance and pedestrian protection requirements — none of which are mandatory
on American vehicles.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The EU’s General Safety Regulation for new vehicles, in
force since July 2024, is expected to save thousands of lives over the years to
come. Brussels must defend it in all trade negotiations — and ensure the public
understands what is at stake.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Antonio Avenoso<br/>
