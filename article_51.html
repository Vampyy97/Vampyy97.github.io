cuts to his agency were already driving more migration to Europe, as he urged
EU capitals to fund existing asylum facilities in Africa rather than create new
systems. Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, told the
Financial Times that there was mounting evidence of Sudanese moving north
towards Europe rather than staying in Sudan or neighbouring Chad, where many
had found support previously.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The budget cuts that are imposed on us by donors are
catastrophic also from the point of view of how you manage these flows,” Grandi
said, adding that ignoring the developments in African countries was “a big
strategic mistake.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Give more assistance to states where people are ready to
stay before going back home. You solve a lot of your problems by doing that,”
he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The UNHCR's budget has been drastically reduced after US
President Donald Trump cut his country’s funding from $2bn to about $390mn this
year. France, Italy and Germany have also cut support, compounding a crisis.
The UN agency has let go of a third of its staff and put programmes worth
$1.4bn on hold.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Faced with a backlog of asylum cases and rising
anti-immigration sentiment, many EU countries have sought to externalize parts
of their asylum systems, including by screening applicants in countries outside
the bloc. Such schemes, driven by countries with hardline stances such as
Denmark and Italy, have been controversial, and previous efforts by the UK to
establish asylum facilities in Rwanda failed over human rights concerns.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Grandi said it would be a “much better investment” to spend
money in countries where there were large refugee populations already that were
ready to stay, such as Chad, Iran or Kenya.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The number of people travelling to Europe via Libya has
recently increased, and EU countries are keen to give the Libyan authorities
more funding to prevent people from crossing the Mediterranean. But efforts to
cooperate with the Libyan authorities and the rival armed groups that control
part of the country have been fraught.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The EU has sealed several agreements with African countries
to halt immigration and is now working on further “solutions” involving non-EU
countries. Proposals include sending rejected asylum seekers to so-called
“return hubs” or screening asylum seekers who have been rescued in the
Mediterranean in northern African countries.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Grandi said his agency was willing to participate in such
schemes if proper safeguards were in place, including that European countries
maintained their responsibility for the people in question. This was not the
case with the UK’s Rwanda scheme.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“If it is dumping the responsibilities of people that are
seeking asylum in Europe entirely on the country selected, then I think it
would be a bit more problematic,” he said. “If it is helping out with a system
that offers sufficient guarantees and respect of international law, maybe yes.”
But he added: “Let’s be realistic. You have to find a country that is willing
to do it. I’m not very optimistic that you have countries queueing up.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Grandi urged European governments to “consult” with the UN,
adding: “There are windows of opportunity to do some of these innovative
things.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
