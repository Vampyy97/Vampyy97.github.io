Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US President Donald Trump shook
hands, smiled, then clinched each other at a group photo for the Nato summit in
The Hague last month.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The “extraordinary” relationship of these two “friends”, as
the pair call each other, has so far delivered a string of mutual wins. Turkey
has secured a better position than many US allies on tariffs. Washington has
lifted sanctions on Syria, as Erdogan wanted. Trump has also turned a blind eye
to Erdogan’s crackdown on the opposition.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Erdogan has, meanwhile, provided his fellow Nato ally with a
venue for diplomatic talks with Russia, and the possibility of a US military
exit from Syria, which Trump has long wanted.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Now, however, their relationship faces two significant
tests. The most urgent involves reconciling Turkey’s support for the government
of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa with destabilising Israeli military actions
in the Arab state. The second is to secure the end of US sanctions on Turkey’s
defence sector to allow a multibillion-dollar F-35 fighter jet deal that
Erdogan has long wanted.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“You can’t underestimate their chemistry,” Soner Cagaptay,
director of the Turkey research programme at The Washington Institute
think-tank, said of the two presidents. “Trump likes strong countries and
powerful leaders — Erdogan delivers both.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Even so, “for all the talk of their bromance, Trump and
Erdogan don’t actually seem to get any deals done,” said Aaron Stein, president
of the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Washington.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nowhere has the “new era in Turkish-American relations” — as
Erdogan has described it — been more evident than in Syria. Turkey’s neighbour
had long been a source of tension because of clashing US and Turkish priorities
— particularly over US support for Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers an
extension of the militant group PKK.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But now Washington appears to all but repeat Turkish talking
points — even when they run counter to Israel’s, which has taken a hostile
stance towards Sharaa.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In June, after speaking with Erdogan, Trump used his
executive powers to lift economic sanctions on Syria, a key Turkish ask. Then
the US this month moved to delist as a terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,
the Syrian president’s former movement — making HTS perhaps the first terror
organisation ever to be delisted by the US before it became defunct.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“This was a big deal for Turkey. It was also a sign of
Trump’s faith in Erdogan,” Cagaptay said. “If Syria is stable, more of the over
3mn Syrian refugees living in Turkey will go back. That in turn helps with
nationalist issues inside Turkey and is a potential vote winner for Erdogan.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Tom Barrack, one of Trump’s friends and the new US
ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, is a crucial go-between. Trump
has tasked Barrack — a smooth talking but tough private equity billionaire of
Lebanese descent — with elevating the bilateral relationship from “great” to
“extraordinary”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Barrack criticised Israel for creating “another very
confusing chapter” after it launched dozens of air strikes in Syria during a
wave of deadly sectarian clashes this month, saying it was acting to protect
the Druze religious minority. This rare public censure of Israel from a US
official appeared to provoke a tacit rebuttal from Israel’s defence minister
Israel Katz: “Those who criticise the attacks are not well versed in the
facts.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The second big test of the Trump-Erdogan relationship is
Turkey’s long-held desire to buy dozens of F-35 stealth fighter jets — a deal
that Erdogan sounded positive about after meeting Trump at The Hague, saying:
“Inshallah, we shall make progress.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">But the obstacles are formidable. The deal was blocked in
2020 under so-called CAATSA sanctions after Erdogan bought two Russian S-400
air defence batteries. Turkish officials have alluded to the S-400s remaining
stored in unopened crates ever since. But “if used, it would be like Russia
plugging a USB stick into Nato’s computer system,” one western official said.
“That is totally unacceptable for us.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Barrack has suggested that a solution, including the
congressional approval required to lift the sanctions, might be found by the
end of this year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the meantime, Turkey is seeking to recapitalise its
ageing air fleet by buying Eurofighter jets. Britain and Turkey signed a
preliminary multibillion-pound deal for the sale of Typhoon jets to Ankara last
week.</p><p class="MsoNormal">On the F-35s, “the successful formula will require both
sides to agree to some concessions to their doctrinal positions,” said Sinan
Ulgen, director of EDAM, an Istanbul think-tank. “Turkey will in essence have
to commit to never using the S-400 in practice — with monitoring to assuage the
trust deficit … But the US will have to show flexibility too.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The stakes are high. If the issue is resolved, Lockheed
Martin could get a multibillion-dollar sales order. Turkish companies could
also get reinserted into the F-35 programme, regaining lucrative contracts that
once included building F-35 fuselages and serving as one of the jet’s main
maintenance hubs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“It’s going to be a long haul,” cautioned Stein. “To buy the
F-35s, Turkey will need military financing — which requires congressional
approval. But Turkey is not popular in Congress, and the Greeks and Israeli
lobby will oppose the deal.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Analysts argue that where there is a will there is a way,
and expect that the F-35 deal will get done one day — even if that requires a
Trump executive order.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Harder to resolve are the growing tensions between Turkey
and Israel. Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said last week Ankara might
intervene if there were further attempts to divide Syria — a prospect that
raises the alarming possibility of clashes between the region’s two most
powerful militaries.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Then there is Iran. Turkey bit its tongue when the US bombed
Iran’s nuclear facilities in June, issuing only a mild rebuke. But Ankara could
fall out completely with the US if there were to be a second round of the
Israel-Iran war that dealt more blows to Tehran and which led to a huge influx
of Iranian refugees into neighbouring Turkey.</p></body></html>
