power</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Jamie Smyth — New York, Song Jung-a — Seoul</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">Canada’s AtkinsRéalis Group plans to deploy its nuclear
reactor technology in the US to compete against Westinghouse, as a growing
number of foreign companies rush to capitalise on Donald Trump’s strategy of
unleashing American atomic energy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Montreal-based group has enlisted support from the
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission for its proposed American expansion and is
scheduling meetings with US officials as it prepares to apply for a reactor
licence from the country’s Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It has also begun
talks with US utilities, which would be the ultimate buyers of its reactors.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“AtkinsRéalis Nuclear has begun to explore opportunities for
alternative large nuclear reactor technologies, notably Candu reactors, in the
US,” Joe St-Julian, global president of nuclear at AtkinsRéalis, told the
Financial Times.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Candu is a type of pressurised heavy-water nuclear reactor,
which does not need enriched uranium so is perceived as cheaper to operate than
most other commercial reactors.</p><p class="MsoNormal">AtkinsRéalis’s push into the US nuclear reactor market
follows publication of four executive orders by the Trump administration in
May, which set targets to quadruple nuclear energy capacity in the country by
2050, start work on 10 large reactors by 2030, and accelerate regulatory
approvals. Billions of dollars of government incentives are expected to be
provided by the administration, which argues new large-scale nuclear plants are
needed to power the artificial intelligence revolution.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Westinghouse, the only US-based company with a large reactor
design approved by the NRC and active in the US industry, has told US officials
it can deploy 10 of its AP1000 reactor designs to meet the administration’s
goals.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But rivals say working on 10 large plants simultaneously
would be a complex and difficult task for a single company, particularly given
that costs are expected to top $75bn, based on government estimates, according
to TD Cowen, an investment bank.</p><p class="MsoNormal">St-Julian said there was huge potential in the US market.
Westinghouse would have “home field advantage” when bidding for contracts but
AtkinsRéalis’s Candu reactor could be a strong competitor, he said. “There used
to be four reactor companies in the US — Westinghouse, General Electric,
Babcock &amp; Wilcox and Utility Engineers — and now there is just one. Could
Westinghouse build 10 AP1000s simultaneously? I don't think so. So I think that
there is an opportunity for Candu in the US.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Adam Stein, a nuclear expert at the Breakthrough Institute,
a Washington think-tank, said booming electricity demand and more flexible
licensing regulations could provide opportunities to new entrants in the US,
such as the Candu reactor. “Candu reactors are typically rather expensive but
they have an existing supply chain in Canada because of a recent refurbishment
programme. This could make a big difference.”</p></body></html>
