thousands of its artificial intelligence drone "strike kits" to
Ukraine to help it combat mass attacks by Russian drones.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lorenz Meier, Auterion chief executive, said the company
would ship 33,000 of its AI strike systems to Ukraine before the end of the
year under a new contract with the US Pentagon.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company's software is already being used in Ukrainian
drones operating combat missions against Russia, but the new commitment, Meier
told the Financial Times, was "10 times in scale". "So we've
shipped thousands and we're now shipping tens of thousands," he said,
adding that the scale was "unprecedented".</p><p class="MsoNormal">Russia's air campaign has escalated in recent weeks, with
hundreds of Iranian-designed Shahed attack drones used in each strike. A single
bombardment now frequently surpasses the number of drones previously launched
over the course of a month. Major cities are being targeted with increased
frequency.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The swarm tactics are also breaching Ukraine's air defences
more often, with strikes hitting targets at roughly three times the usual rate
in recent months, according to official data.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Auterion's "strike kits" — miniature computers
known as Skynode that run the company's software and include a camera and radio
— can transform manually controlled drones into "AI-powered weapons
systems" that cannot be jammed and can track a moving target from as far
away as 1km, said Meier.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The commitment comes after Auterion, which is headquartered
in Virginia in the US, secured a contract worth close to $50mn from the
Pentagon to deliver the systems. The contract is part of the US government's
security assistance to Ukraine, said Meier.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It was not part of a drone "mega-deal" that
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this month said he was discussing with
his US counterpart Donald Trump, with the aim of boosting industrial
co-operation between the two countries. But Meier said that his company had
"pioneered" US-Ukrainian co-production.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"It's basically acknowledging that the battle-hardening
that has happened in Ukraine of drone products is relevant. That it's a way to
support Ukraine, but it's also technology that... Nato countries want to get
their hands on."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Meier said he expected further deals for Auterion software
with European countries. The company also has offices in Munich. Auterion's
software, said Meier, would enable the "next evolution in warfare",
allowing swarms of autonomous drones to communicate with each other. "What
we are providing is leapfrogging what's on the battlefield right now, which is
to go to AI-based targeting and swarming." Humans would always select the
targets, though, he added.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
