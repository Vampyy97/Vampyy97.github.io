childcare subsidies as it steps up efforts to boost birth rates and give more
spending power to households with young children. The government will give
families Rmb3,600 ($503) a year for each child under the age of three, state
news agency Xinhua said yesterday. The subsidy will be applied from January
2025 but families with children born between 2022 and 2024 can apply for
partial handouts.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The policy is expected to benefit more than 20mn families
each year, Xinhua reported, citing a spokesperson from China’s National Health
Commission. A health commission official said “the direct distribution of cash
subsidies” could “help alleviate the financial burden of raising children” and
“assuage the fertility anxieties of young couples”, Xinhua said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The measure, long discussed by academics and policymakers,
is a response to China’s looming demographic crisis, fuelled by plunging
fertility rates and a decline in marriages. It is also an effort to boost weak
consumer spending in the world’s second largest economy, despite recent robust
quarterly economic growth.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The sums involved are too small to have a near-term impact
on the birth rate or consumption,” said Zichun Huang, China economist at
Capital Economics. “But the policy does mark a major milestone in terms of
direct handouts to households and could lay the groundwork for more fiscal
transfers in future.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">China has recorded three consecutive years of population
decline despite the end of a decades-long one-child policy that restricted the
size of families until 2016. The number of births rose by about 520,000 last
year to 9.5mn, barely half of the peak of 17.9mn in 2017. There were 10.9mn
deaths in 2024.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The subsidies also follow months of calls for the government
to support household consumption. While China recorded real economic growth of
5.2 per cent in the second quarter, widespread falling prices meant nominal
growth was much weaker at 3.9 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The move echoes initiatives from other countries facing
demographic strains, from income tax breaks for new mothers in Hungary to
childcare subsidies in Poland and cash payments in South Korea and Japan.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
