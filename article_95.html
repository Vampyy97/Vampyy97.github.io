ends crisis in Gaza</h2><p class="MsoNormal">DAVID SHEPPARD AND GEORGE PARKER — LONDON</p><p class="MsoNormal">The UK will recognise a Palestinian state in September
unless Israel takes immediate steps to end the crisis in Gaza, its government
said yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Amid mounting international outcry over the humanitarian
crisis, Downing Street said it was "determined to protect the viability of
the two-state solution."</p><p class="MsoNormal">As a result, it said, the UK would "recognise the state
of Palestine in September before [the UN General Assembly] unless the Israeli
government takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza and
commits to a long-term sustainable peace."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Among those steps, the UK government said Israel had to
allow the UN "to restart without delay the supply of humanitarian support
to the people of Gaza to end starvation". Sir Keir Starmer said: "I
have always said that we will recognise a Palestinian state at the moment of
maximum impact for the two-state solution... With that solution now under
threat, this is the moment to act."</p><p class="MsoNormal">The British prime minister added that Hamas must play
"no part in the governance of Gaza" and called on them to disarm and
release the remaining Israeli hostages. He said at least 500 food trucks needed
to enter Gaza every day.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Downing Street also demanded that Israel agree to a
ceasefire and make clear that there would be no annexations in the West Bank.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Israel’s foreign ministry said the UK’s announcement
"constitutes a reward for Hamas and harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire
in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages".<br/>
Gaza’s escalating humanitarian crisis has intensified pressure on Israel in
recent days. The UN-backed global food security body said yesterday that famine
was spreading, with one in three children in Gaza City acutely malnourished.
Starmer’s announcement came a day after Donald Trump said he would not “mind”
the British prime minister taking a position on recognising a Palestinian
state, adding: “I’m looking for getting people fed right now.” The US president
has indicated growing frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, who has said there is “no starvation” in Gaza. Starmer convened his
cabinet yesterday to discuss the situation in Gaza, which he has called
“revolting.” The entire cabinet backed the move.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Gaza famine and West’s risk page 2</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
