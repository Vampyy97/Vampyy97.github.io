marginalisation</h2><p class="MsoNormal">Earlier in July, the European Commission fired the starting
gun on a 30-month marathon negotiation on the EU’s next seven-year budget.
Brussels has proposed a nearly €2tn common spending pot it claims faces up to
Europe’s “new and emerging challenges”. Does it?</p><p class="MsoNormal">First, the good. Brussels has taken some steps towards
reallocating funds to today’s priorities: infrastructure, defence, security,
research and energy and industrial resilience. The exact numbers are already
the subject of fights, even inside the commission itself. But just as important
is the lack of controversy around the methodological changes to the budget.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The commission rolls agricultural subsidies and transfers to
poorer regions into new national plans, to be proposed by governments, approved
by the EU and checked against delivery to release funding. This marks a major
shift, modelled on the post-pandemic recovery fund. Grumbles can be heard about
insufficient funding and a power grab by national governments from local
officials. But not about the basic principle of cash in return for
demonstrable, mutually agreed reforms.</p><p class="MsoNormal">That is a quiet revolution from the habit of simply sending
checks to farmers and local governments; the most remarkable thing about the
budget draft was the least remarked upon. Another change seemingly received
without objection is the streamlining of the budget into fewer funding streams.
This simplification should speed up disbursement and ease planning and
co-ordination.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Next, the bad. The commission has reprioritised its budget
with a view to the changing geopolitical landscape. The commission’s new
spending priorities show it has listened to warnings in the Enrico Letta and
Mario Draghi reports. But it has missed the opportunity to integrate budget
politics more closely with strategic calls to unify the single market and boost
productivity. A case in point is the ill-judged idea of lump-sum taxes on EU
companies with large turnover. Brussels is right to seek new revenue sources.
But any business levy should be designed within its planned pan-EU corporate
code. Getting a share of the corporate tax base from companies choosing this
regime is better than slapping a new tax on top of existing ones.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The budget also fails to address the need for more equity
funding for companies in key strategic sectors, set out convincingly in a
report by the European Policy Centre that proposes an off-budget instrument
resembling an EU sovereign wealth fund making equity investments in the bloc.
This is a good idea. So is the EPC’s call to securitise EU-funded common
European industrial and infrastructure projects. Both would boost the growth of
badly needed pan-EU capital markets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A third weakness is the commission’s lack of attention to
providing investors with pan-EU safe benchmark securities. The budget draft
does nothing to promote this. More common debt is a politically explosive idea.
But it need not be raised for subsidising poorer members; a stronger
justification is to fund an EU sovereign wealth fund.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Finally, the ugly. Brussels commits the statistical sin of
using nominal numbers, which mainly reflect inflation, to claim a large
increase in the budget. The relevant measure of resources is the share of gross
national income the budget allocates to common priorities. The last budget came
to a little over 1 per cent of EU GNI. Adding in the special post-pandemic
debt-financed fund, the total came to 1.7 per cent. The new draft budget is for
1.26 per cent of GNI, but after deducting the money needed to pay down common
debts, it’s a mere 1.15 per cent — an amount that will be further whittled down
in talks. A proposal to spend one-third less of an already tiny share of
resources makes a mockery of all the strategic evangelising. This is a budget
that ensures continued geopolitical marginalisation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As the great American philosophers Ralph Waldo Emerson and
Omar Little have argued, if you “come at the king, you best not miss”. If the
EU wants to hold its own in world affairs, it must give itself the resources
for it. Getting more success is more likely for off-budget ideas such as the
EPC’s, common borrowing for a sovereign wealth fund and a delay to paying down
existing debt to free up funds. Both EU and national leaders accept they face
unprecedented, perhaps existential, risks. They must now admit those cannot be
addressed on the cheap.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b> </b></p></body></html>
