Beijing could drag down inflation in the Eurozone if cheap Chinese goods are
diverted from the US to the currency area, European Central Bank economists
have warned.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A major rerouting of Chinese goods to Europe could push
inflation in the euro area further below the central bank’s target of 2 per
cent next year, a team of ECB economists noted in a blog post yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The euro area could see imports from China rise by up to 10
per cent in 2026,” they wrote, adding that this was equivalent to about 1.3 per
cent of overall consumption of goods in the Eurozone.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While the economists did not analyse the implications of
such a scenario for monetary policy, undershooting inflation would strengthen
the case for further cuts in the ECB’s benchmark interest rate. Frankfurt
rate-setters kept their key rate unchanged at 2 per cent last week in their
final meeting before the summer break.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In their most recent forecast for consumer prices, published
in June, ECB economists predicted that inflation would average 1.6 per cent in
2026, owing to a stronger euro and falling energy prices.</p><p class="MsoNormal">If the US were to reimpose punitive import duties exceeding
100 per cent on Chinese products, and goods were redirected to Europe, annual
inflation in the Eurozone could fall by another 0.15 percentage points in 2026,
“with smaller effects persisting into 2027,” the ECB economists wrote.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This year, US President Donald Trump increased tariffs on
imports from China to 145 per cent, prompting Beijing to impose a retaliatory
rate of 125 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In May, the two countries agreed a 90-day pause that
included reducing so-called reciprocal tariffs to allow time to negotiate a
more comprehensive trade deal. During two days of talks in Stockholm this week,
the countries discussed an extension to the ceasefire, but this would require
Trump's approval.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Eurozone economy unexpectedly expanded by 0.1 per cent
in the second quarter despite the trade tensions, according to an estimate
released yesterday. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted zero growth.</p><p class="MsoNormal">German official statistics also released yesterday showed
the region's biggest economy contracted by 0.1 per cent during the period.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“There are increasing signs that private consumption in the
euro area is recovering,” Commerzbank economists wrote in a note to clients,
adding that annual growth in the currency area this year could be a shade
better than the 0.9 per cent the ECB predicted in June, further reducing the
odds of another rate cut.Since the ECB’s decision to hold rates, traders in
swaps markets have lowered their bets on another quarterpoint cut in September
or October.</p></body></html>
