$300mn bondholders deal</h2><p class="MsoNormal">EUAN HEALY AND ROBERT SMITH<br/>
LONDON</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img height="427" src="FT_files/image037.png" width="375"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">Paul Coulson has struck a deal with Ardagh Group bondholders
for shareholders to receive $300 million to walk away from the debt-laden
packaging group that the Irish entrepreneur built through decades of
acquisitions.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ardagh, which is based in Luxembourg and makes glass bottles
and metal cans in Europe, the US and Africa, announced the restructuring deal
yesterday, capping more than a year of negotiations with creditors owed more
than $10 billion built up in the era of cheap money and low interest rates.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Coulson is ceding control of Ardagh to a group of
bondholders under the terms of the deal, ending a decades-long streak as one of
the most significant figures in the European junk bond market.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The 72-year-old transformed Ardagh into one of the world’s
largest packaging groups through leveraged buyouts.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While Coulson controls more than 50 per cent of Ardagh’s
voting rights, his economic stake is smaller at 36 per cent so he will receive
just over $100 million of the $300 million payout.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Control is set to be passed to Ardagh’s unsecured
bondholders as part of a debt-for-equity swap. The group’s riskiest $1.7
billion of payment-in-kind bonds will be fully written off in exchange for a
small minority stake in the business.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Bondholders will also provide $1.5 billion of new funding to
the group while a loan that Apollo Global Management provided last year will be
repaid in full.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Coulson’s investment in Ardagh began with a troubled airline
leasing business in the 1990s. After winning a payout from the investment bank
that advised on a soured acquisition that brought his company to its knees,
Coulson used the cash to acquire a stake in a small Dublin-based bottling
company.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A series of debt-fuelled acquisitions over the next two
decades transformed it into one of the world’s biggest producers of glass and
metal drinks containers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ardagh’s frequent issuance of junk bonds made it one of the
largest players in Europe’s market for riskier debt.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But interest rate and energy cost increases in recent years
have hit the highly levered business, which faces billions in upcoming
maturities.</p><p class="MsoNormal">After creditors last month offered Ardagh shareholders $250
million to walk away, the Financial Times reported that Coulson had insisted on
them receiving $300 million to consider giving up the company, along with other
conditions around securing the money swiftly.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The transaction will preserve the group’s ownership of its
glass and metal packaging businesses and puts in place a sustainable capital
structure with significantly lower leverage and an enhanced maturity profile,”
said Herman Troskie, Ardagh group chair.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
