recent months about their willingness to go the whole nine yards to protect
European customers’ digital sovereignty. Barbara Moens rightly questions the
extent to which these promises will amount to true sovereignty (The Big Read,
July 21).</p><p class="MsoNormal">However she misses one crucial thing: it’s not just critics
of Big Tech that have said the hyperscalers can’t give Europe sovereignty —
Microsoft itself has admitted as much.</p><p class="MsoNormal">On June 10, Microsoft France's legal director, Anton
Carniaux, admitted under oath to the French Senate that the company could not
guarantee that French users’ data stored in the EU would be protected from US
agencies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US Cloud Act is abundantly clear that American companies
can be required to hand over any user data to US law enforcement at any time —
no matter where in the world it is stored, and without the consent or knowledge
of the business or government of the country in question. True, companies can
challenge this if they’re so inclined, but there’s no way to know whether this
would be upheld: it’s certainly not a strong foundation on which to build a
“sovereign” cloud.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This isn't a point of technicality or tedious bureaucracy
either. Scottish police admitted last year that crucial and sensitive data
could be transferred out of jurisdiction and beyond intended control due to its
use of Microsoft's public cloud. Surely we can't turn a blind eye to something
that’s already having an impact on our vital public institutions?</p><p class="MsoNormal">Other countries should take this chance to follow the French
example and start asking hyperscalers some serious questions — and perhaps
quietly start planning to reduce our increasing reliance on Big Tech in case
they don’t like the answers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Mark Boost<br/>
