budget rules, thanks to an exemption that applies to its increase in defence
spending, Brussels’ top economic official has said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Europe's largest economy is forecast to record an excess
deficit of 3.3 per cent in 2025, but this is fully accounted for by an increase
in defence spending, EU economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told the
Financial Times. Berlin, therefore, “is likely not to end up in [the] excessive
deficit procedure,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The EU rules — which Germany helped design — dictate that
member states must keep their budget deficit within 3 per cent of GDP and
public debt below 60 per cent of GDP. A country could face fines if it does not
take corrective measures to meet the rules.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A final assessment of Germany’s position will take place
next spring when full data for 2025 is available, Dombrovskis said, adding: “We
have to see the execution, because it’s close, [but] if everything holds, then
it should not be the case for this year’s budget.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Berlin’s narrow escape signals a willingness from Brussels
to allow the bloc’s largest economy to spend lavishly at a time of higher
defence needs and low growth. Germany plans to exceed a 3 per cent annual
deficit threshold this year to the end of 2027, according to its own fiscal
plan.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But the “national escape clause,” invoked by Germany and 15
other EU countries, allows member states to spend up to 1.5 per cent of their
output on defence over four years without breaking the rules.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The clause was added at Germany's behest this year to
accommodate higher defence spending, given US demands on EU countries to boost
their own security and a new Nato target to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence
by 2035.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The request was a stark about-face from Germany, which
during a recent reform of fiscal rules asked for strict safeguards for
countries that breached EU debt and deficit thresholds. In negotiations over
the past few months with Berlin over its fiscal plan, Brussels granted Germany
a right to “backload” measures to reduce its budget deficit towards the later
years of its plan.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Brussels has also accepted Germany’s estimate for the
potential growth impact of Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s €500bn infrastructure
investment fund and increased defence spending at 0.9 per cent on average until
2041 — up from 0.3 per cent in 2025 — something German officials stress is
allowed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Brussels’ leniency towards Berlin is due to its relatively
low debt levels, projected to come in only slightly above the EU's 60 per cent
threshold at 63.8 per cent of GDP this year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The commission has been quite lax in its interpretation of
the fiscal rules towards Germany,” said Guntram Wolff, a senior fellow at
think-tank Bruegel and a professor of economics at the Free University of
Brussels. “At some level, that is understandable given that debt levels are low
and also the deficit levels are small compared to France. At another level, it
is weakening the just reformed fiscal rules.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
