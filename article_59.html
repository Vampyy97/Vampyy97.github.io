attacks on merchant ships, raising the risk for ships on the vital trade route
through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Iran-backed group said in a statement it would attack
ships belonging to any company trading with Israel “regardless of the
nationality of that company”. The group, which started its attacks in November
2023 and claims to be acting in support of Gaza’s Palestinians, said it was
reacting to “rapid developments” in the enclave.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Houthis in early July sank two ships — the Magic Seas
and the Eternity C — in their first Red Sea attacks on merchant shipping since
December.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Houthi attacks have sharply reduced the numbers of vessels
using the Red Sea and Suez Canal to sail between Asia and Europe, with many
shipowners diverting via the longer route round the Cape of Good Hope.</p><p class="MsoNormal">At least 11 members of the Eternity C’s crew are still being
held by the Houthis in Yemen, according to one person familiar with the
situation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Martin Kelly, head of advisory for EOS Risk Group, said
Sunday’s statement signalled a “shift in intent” from the Houthis. “I think we
could see some attacks in the near term,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Another maritime security expert, speaking on condition of
anonymity, pointed out there was widespread international disquiet at the
worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “I would have thought, given what is
going on in Gaza and the international outrage about it, that would give them
cover [for renewed attacks].”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kelly suggested the statement’s reference to attacking ships
linked to any country might indicate a renewed willingness to attack US-linked
vessels. The Houthis have been observing an apparent ceasefire with the US in
which they avoided attacking American-linked ships while the US held off
attacking Houthi assets in Yemen.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The other maritime expert pointed out that the Houthis’
announced targeting criteria were often very loosely applied. When it said it
was attacking ships linked to Israel, the UK and the US, it attacked many
vessels with only tenuous links to those countries, sometimes on the basis of
outdated information.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“In the past, they've... attacked a ship and found a link
afterwards,” the expert said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As well as the crew members being held by the Houthis, 10
seafarers from the Eternity C were rescued by a private security contractor
after the attack, according to the person familiar with the situation. Two are
confirmed dead, while another two are presumed dead. Only two previous attacks
by the group had been fatal, with a total of four seafarers killed in previous
incidents.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The person said there were no current negotiations under way
between Cosmosphips Management, the Eternity C’s manager, and the Houthis for
the seafarers release.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
