conglomerate said yesterday, amid government investigations and a corporate
turnaround effort to return to earnings growth next year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In its results for the three months ending in June, the
health and insurance group reported net earnings of $3.4bn, a 19 per cent fall
on the same period last year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Earnings per share were $3.74, down from $4.54 a year ago
and below analyst estimates of $4.22, according to S&amp;P.</p><p class="MsoNormal">UnitedHealth’s shares fell 5.8 per cent in late-morning
trading and its stock is down 46 per cent this year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday's earnings marked the first for chief executive
Stephen Hemsley since his return as CEO in May, replacing Andrew Witty, a
former GlaxoSmithKline CEO, who stepped down as the company pulled its annual
guidance, sending UnitedHealth’s stock to the lowest level in more than four
years.</p><p class="MsoNormal">UnitedHealth had outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index for
years, with a business model that included health insurance, primary care and
pharmacy services.</p><p class="MsoNormal">UnitedHealth is the biggest employer of physicians in the
US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But recently, the group has been hurt by higher patient
claims costs. The company underestimated these, prompting its first-quarter
earnings miss and its decision to withdraw guidance in May.</p><p class="MsoNormal">UnitedHealth yesterday re-established future guidance,
estimating its 2025 revenue would be $445.5bn to $448bn and net earnings would
be at least $14.65 per share. It said it expected to return to earnings growth
in 2026.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But it said its growth would be stung by $1.6bn “of
potential settlement items”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US Department of Justice is examining UnitedHealth’s
large Medicare Advantage unit. Last week, UnitedHealth acknowledged it was
under a DoJ criminal investigation concerning its Medicare billing programme.</p></body></html>
