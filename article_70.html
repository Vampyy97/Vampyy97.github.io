in total pay last year, making him the highest paid chief executive of a
London-listed business.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Eamonn O’Hare of Zegona received £129mn from a management
share incentive scheme in the year ending December 2024, according to the
company’s annual report, in addition to base salary and other benefits
totalling slightly less than £1.5mn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company’s chief operating officer, Robert Samuelson, was
paid a total of £66mn in 2024. The figures were first reported by the Sunday
Times newspaper.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Zegona, which was founded by O’Hare and Samuelson — both
former Virgin Media executives — in 2015, specialises in buying, turning around
and selling struggling telecoms groups. The most high-profile of its deals was
its €5bn acquisition of Vodafone's Spanish business last year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Since a 2023 capital raise to help finance the deal,
Zegona’s share price has risen from about £1.50 in November that year to more
than £8.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In its annual report, Zegona said it had returned Vodafone
Spain to growth and cut costs, including a 28 per cent reduction in headcount.
The report noted the “exceptional contribution” of management over a three-year
period from October 2021 to October 2024.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Zegona did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The pay for the Zegona executives is much higher than the UK standard, which
has long lagged behind the US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">According to the High Pay Centre, a UK think-tank, median
