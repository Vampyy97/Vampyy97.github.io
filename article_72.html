Giulio Cesare in Egitto<br/>
Haus für Mozart, Salzburg<br/>

immediately. Nobody in Salzburg’s Haus für Mozart moves, because this is what
we're here for: Dmitri Tcherniakov’s reimagining of the crisis that
precipitates the action of Handel’s <i>Giulio Cesare in Egitto</i>. We're
already in the bunker. Together.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Tyrants, siblings, lovers, royals, associates: everyone is
thrown together in a series of interconnected concrete spaces. Every now and
then, a bomb falls above with a terrifying thud, and the walls reverberate.</p><p class="MsoNormal">At first, Cornelia still finds time to fix her lipstick,
while Cleopatra preens and flirts. By the end, everyone on stage is smeared in
grime and traumatised — not because of the war above, but because of what these
people do to one another below.</p><p class="MsoNormal">And although Tcherniakov earned a good storm of boos from
the opening night traditionalists at his curtain call, this is the real heart
of Handel’s opera.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The popular director has never tackled baroque music before,
but he has fully grasped the concept of affect, the notion of action that
propels its protagonist from one emotional extreme to the next. In his telling,
Cesare is a self-assured ruler, Cleopatra a calculating seductress, her brother
Tolomeo a cold-blooded psychopath, Cornelia (widow of Pompeo, Cesare’s rival) a
domineering mother to the damaged, fragile Sesto.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Tcherniakov manages the action with skill, dramatic flair,
and unfailing trust in the score, somehow conjuring endless surprises from
familiar material. Countertenor Christophe Dumaux could have been born to play
Giulio Cesare, delivering a beefily masculine account of the virtuosic role — a
formidable achievement. Olga Kulchynska grows in stature as the evening
progresses; her Cleopatra has immense character, depth and passion. Lucile
Richardot has an oddly androgynous voice; her Cornelia shines more for her
nuanced acting. Dumaux inevitably blows his fellow countertenors out of the
water, with Yuriy Mynenko’s Tolomeo sounding initially insecure, and Federico
Fiorio’s Sesto underpowered — though the latter reveals wonderful agility and
delicacy in a voice that would be better suited to smaller venues.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Le Concert d’Astrée plays well enough for conductor
Emmanuelle Haim, and she supports her singers faithfully, but her Handel is
insipid and flat. Slow movements pool and stagnate; she seems to have no
ability to shape leading voices with momentum, or phrase in a way that drives
the music forwards. There's little love for the small moment, and no great
insights into a score that demands better. Even the thrilling horn solo in
Cesare’s famous hunting aria sounds strained and over-controlled — a moment that
more mutual trust could have made electric.</p><p class="MsoNormal">When Tcherniakov’s staging seems to flatten, the fault lies
with Haim; in other hands, this would be a consummately thrilling evening.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To August 17, salzburgerfestspiele.at</p></body></html>
