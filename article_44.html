hell in the office”, July 21) reminded me of the training film I was shown when
I started work in the 1970s.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Filmed I suspect many years previously, it assumed much of
the audience would be unfamiliar with the telephone outside of the workplace.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It did however include one “hint” which I find useful to
this day. When a call is unexpectedly disconnected the original instigator
should be the one to redial. This avoids the problem as famously portrayed in
the film <i>10</i> where Dudley Moore and Julie Andrews are at either
end of the line, each trying to call but finding the other always engaged.</p><p class="MsoNormal">William Claxton-Smith<br/>
