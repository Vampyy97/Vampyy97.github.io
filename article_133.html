continues to gain momentum (“Union boss calls for law to ban phones in
schools,” Report, April 11). Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, has said
a ban is unnecessary, and I’m inclined to agree.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Many teachers use these devices to access a wide range of
educational resources: applications to “gamify” classes, specialised websites
or the projection or use of multimedia materials.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Studies have shown that students who are taught with
gamification techniques that leverage game design elements like points, badges
and leader boards to enhance student engagement and motivation experience
significantly lower levels of stress and anxiety (than those that only learn
through traditional methods). Another meta-analysis found that game-based
learning can improve learning outcomes, student attitudes and reduce student
anxiety.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For all these reasons, I believe that there are many more
advantages than disadvantages to the use of technology in the classroom. We
must be aware that the younger generations are digital natives, they are
surrounded by technology, and therefore, they are more predisposed to utilise
it for revision and learning activities.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps part of the solution to the problem of excessive use
of screens in the classroom is understanding that traditional methods can
coexist with new tools.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In short, the government should establish regulations on the
use of mobiles in the classroom, providing guidance on the correct and
responsible use of electronic devices.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ultimately, discussion should not be whether we ban or allow
smartphones but rather how and when we use these technologies to help make
learning more engaging for all students.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Eilert Giertsen Hanoa<br/>
