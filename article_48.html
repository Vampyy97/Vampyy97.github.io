technology exports to China to avoid hurting ongoing trade talks with Beijing
and to help President Donald Trump secure a meeting with President Xi Jinping
this year, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security,
which runs export controls, has been asked to hold off on tough moves on China,
according to multiple current and former US officials. US and Chinese officials
met in Stockholm yesterday for a third round of trade talks, following previous
meetings in Geneva and London.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While Trump wants to avoid actions that could disrupt
efforts to meet Xi, some officials argue that the US is hamstrung on export
controls because of the risk that China retaliates by restricting the export of
rare earths and magnets. China had already imposed such curbs in May for the
first time.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Earlier this year, Trump’s team prepared to restrict
technology exports to China. In April, they notified Nvidia that it would block
the export of its H20 chip, which was designed for the Chinese market after the
Biden administration had already restricted more advanced chips. However, Trump
reversed course following direct lobbying from Nvidia chief executive Jensen
Huang.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The H20 has become the focus of a power struggle between
security officials, who say the chip will help China’s military, and Nvidia,
which argues that blocking US technology exports will simply push Chinese
groups to accelerate innovation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Twenty national security experts and former
officials—including Matt Pottinger, deputy national security adviser in Trump’s
first administration—were understood to be writing to Commerce Secretary Howard
Lutnick to express concern. The letter, seen by the Financial Times, was also
signed by David Feith, former top National Security Council technology official
in the current Trump administration, and Liza Tobin, who served in the NSC
during Trump’s first term. Kyle Bass, a Trump supporter and founder of Hayman
Capital Management, also signed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The experts argue that the H20 is a “potent accelerator of
China’s frontier AI capabilities,” outpacing the advanced Nvidia H100 chip
(which is blocked for export) in “inference”—the execution of AI functions as
opposed to the training of AI models. They warn that it would help China
develop autonomous weapon systems, intelligence surveillance platforms, and
other military advancements.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nvidia said the criticisms in the letter were “misguided”
and “inconsistent” with the AI action plan recently unveiled by Trump.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
