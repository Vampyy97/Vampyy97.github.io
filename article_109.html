combination</h2><p class="MsoNormal">OLIVER BARNES — NEW YORK</p><p class="MsoNormal">US railroad operator Union Pacific has agreed to acquire
Norfolk Southern in the biggest deal of the year, which will create a
transcontinental rail juggernaut valued at $250bn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The largely stock-based tie-up, which would forge the
largest railroad operator in the country with more than 50,000 miles of track
across 43 states, comes as the industry grapples with weaker freight volumes as
well as high fuel and labour costs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A combination of Union Pacific, which operates west of the
Mississippi River, and Norfolk Southern, in the east, would be the first
operator in US history capable of carrying goods from the Pacific coast to the
Atlantic on its own tracks. It would also help to ease a logjam around the main
interchange point in Chicago.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal, announced yesterday, is likely to face intense
scrutiny from regulators. The industry’s last significant tie-up, Canadian
Pacific’s $31bn takeover of Kansas City Southern, took about two years to
secure regulatory approval.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The fate of the deal will probably hinge on whether it can
be pitched to President Donald Trump’s administration as a boon for US
infrastructure and way to cut clients’ costs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">‘Railroads have been an integral part of building America
since the Industrial Revolution.’</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal values Norfolk Southern at $320 a share, giving the
group an $85bn enterprise value. Union Pacific has an enterprise value of about
$165bn, making the combined group worth about $250bn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Railroads have been an integral part of building America
since the Industrial Revolution, and this transaction is the next step in
advancing the industry,” said Jim Vena, Union Pacific’s chief executive.</p><p class="MsoNormal">About a quarter of the acquisition will be paid for in cash
and the remainder in stock. Norfolk Southern shareholders will receive one
Union Pacific share and $88.82 in cash for each share of Norfolk Southern, the
companies said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Republican-controlled Surface Transportation Board, the
industry regulator, will have to approve the deal, and interested parties,
including the justice department, labour unions and rail operators such as
Amtrak, will be given the opportunity to raise any objections.</p><p class="MsoNormal">If it were to secure regulatory approval, the acquisition
would be the biggest since Microsoft’s $75.4bn takeover of Activision Blizzard,
which closed in 2023. Similar to the Activision Blizzard takeover and Nippon
Steel’s acquisition of US Steel, the railway merger will face a long, drawn-out
path to closing.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal is structured without a voting trust, a mechanism
that in past US rail mergers has allowed shareholders in a target company to
sell up and avoid the risks of the STB’s approval process. If the agreement
does fall apart, Union Pacific will have to pay Norfolk Southern a $2.5bn
reverse termination fee.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Mark George, Norfolk Southern’s chief executive, said the
deal would contribute “to igniting rail’s ability to deliver for the whole
American economy today and into the future”.</p></body></html>
