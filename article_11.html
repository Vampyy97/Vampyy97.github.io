Trump</h2><p class="MsoNormal">MICHAEL STOTT — BRASILIA</p><p class="MsoNormal">Brazil will double down on its commitment to the Brics bloc,
the Brazilian president’s top foreign policy adviser has said, a move that
defies US President Donald Trump’s threats to impose punitive tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump has taken aim at Brazil twice this month. As the
country hosted a summit for the 11-member Brics, he threatened a 10 per cent
tariff against any nation “aligning themselves” with the “anti-American” bloc.
Trump then pledged 50 per cent levies on Brazil and demanded it end the trial
of hard-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is charged with plotting a
coup.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But Celso Amorim, lead foreign affairs adviser to leftwing
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, told the Financial Times those attacks
“are reinforcing our relations with the Brics, because we want to have
diversified relations and not depend on any one country.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">On top of the Brics — which includes China, Russia and India
— Amorim said Brazil would look to bolster relations with other countries in
Europe, South America and Asia.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The 50 per cent tariff is among the highest mentioned by the
US president in his current round of negotiations, despite Brazil running a
trade deficit with the US in goods — unlike many other countries targeted.
Trump also blasted Lula’s government for what he said are attacks on free
speech, a “ridiculous censorship regime” and “very unfair” trade practices.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lula has rejected Trump's tactics, saying the US president
was elected “not to be emperor of the world”. He added that if Trump’s actions
during the January 6 Capitol insurrection had been committed in Brazil, he
would be standing trial.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Amorim said Trump’s interference in Brazil’s internal
affairs was something not seen “even in colonial times”. “I don’t think even
the Soviet Union would have done anything like this,” he said, adding that
Trump “was trying to act politically inside [Brazil] in favour of his friend.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">While China is the country’s biggest trading partner,
importing $94bn of mainly agricultural goods and minerals from Brazil last
year, Amorim said “it’s not our intention” for Beijing to be the clear winner
from Trump’s higher tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Amorim denied that the Brics is ideological. He called for
the EU to quickly ratify a long-stalled trade treaty with the Mercosur group of
South American countries. “If the EU were intelligent, it would ratify it not
just for the immediate economic gain but also for more balance in its
relations,” Amorim said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Amorim said Canada was interested in negotiating a free
trade deal with Brazil, and added that the last year of Lula’s government was
likely to see greater focus on South America.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Remembering the diplomatic maxim that “countries have no
friends, only interests,” Amorim said Trump was an unusual case because he had
“neither friends nor interests, just wishes”. The US president’s approach is
“an illustration of absolute power,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
