US dominance</h2><p class="MsoNormal">WILLIAM LANGLEY — GUANGZHOU<br/>
ELEANOR OLCOTT AND RYAN MCMORROW — SHANGHAI</p><p class="MsoNormal">China has unveiled a sweeping plan to expand its role in
artificial intelligence governance, including the creation of a global
co-operation organisation, as Beijing vies with Washington for technological
leadership.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Speaking at the opening of the World Artificial Intelligence
Conference in Shanghai on Saturday, Chinese premier Li Qiang said AI innovation
was hindered by “bottlenecks” such as the supply of computer chips.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Without explicitly mentioning the US, he took aim at
“technological monopolies” and restrictions that could lead to AI becoming “an
exclusive game for a few countries and companies”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Currently, overall global AI governance is still
fragmented. Countries have great differences, particularly in terms of areas
such as regulatory concepts [and] institutional rules,” Li said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We should strengthen co-ordination to form a global AI
governance framework that has broad consensus as soon as possible,” he said,
adding that China would help create “a world AI co-operation organisation”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">After Li spoke, the foreign ministry published a 13-point
plan for the global governance of AI that proposed the creation of two new AI
dialogue mechanisms under the auspices of the UN and a safety governance
framework.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In recent months, Beijing has promoted China’s “open”
innovation and willingness to “share indigenous technologies”. The country’s
top AI groups, DeepSeek and Alibaba, have made their large language models, or
LLMs, available to developers worldwide as open-source technology.</p><p class="MsoNormal">China’s plan includes a push for greater co-operation on
open-source technology through new transnational platforms and developer
communities, and sharing of crucial software and hardware such as
semiconductors.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The country’s swath of advanced open-source LLMs has raised
concerns in the US that low-cost Chinese tech will undermine Silicon Valley’s
global dominance and pricing.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Li’s comments reflect the intense rivalry with the US over
the technology, with Washington restricting exports to China of advanced
semiconductors and the equipment used to make them, and pressing allies to do
the same. China has still managed to make advances, with the release of an LLM
by Hangzhou-based DeepSeek this year that sparked a debate about whether the US
could maintain its technological edge.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We are willing to provide more Chinese solutions to the
international community and contribute more Chinese wisdom to global artificial
intelligence governance,” Li said, adding that AI would be a new engine of
economic growth. He said China was especially eager to share technologies with
countries in the global south to “make the achievements of AI development
better benefit the world”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">China’s foreign ministry said it had invited representatives
from more than 40 countries and international organisations to attend the
four-day AI conference and exhibition.</p><p class="MsoNormal">China’s plan comes days after the White House unveiled a
plan to achieve US dominance in AI. It focused on accelerating innovation by
cutting red tape, building infrastructure and ensuring the US led in
international AI diplomacy and security.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
