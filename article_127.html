after profits soar</h2><p class="MsoNormal">TOM WILSON — LONDON</p><p class="MsoNormal">Vitol handed a record $10.6bn to its senior employees
through share buybacks last year after a period of unrivalled growth for the
world’s largest independent commodity trader.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The record payout follows $6.4bn awarded through the scheme
in 2023 and far exceeds pay at Vitol’s rivals, Trafigura, Mercuria and Gunvor.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The group, whose chief executive is based in London, is
owned by about 600 senior employees spread across principal trading hubs in
London, Geneva, Singapore and Houston.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Based on that number, each partner received an average of
more than $17.5mn last year, although many senior executives are likely to have
received much more.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The high remuneration, disclosed in accounts filed in
Luxembourg, follows three years of soaring profits for Vitol. The group
significantly outperformed its closest rivals during the disruption in energy
markets that followed Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Vitol made net profits of $8.7bn last year, the filings
show, after recording earnings of $13.2bn in 2023 and $15.1bn in 2022. In those
three years alone, Vitol made almost double its total profits over the previous
decade, according to Financial Times calculations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The trading house, which will be 60 years old next year, is
one of the most powerful players in global energy markets yet remains
relatively little known outside the industry. Senior executives limit public
appearances to a handful of industry events each year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While privately held rivals, including Trafigura, publish
their accounts, Vitol does not — so the figures are only available once its
Luxembourg-registered parent company files its accounts in July.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The share buyback was bigger than Vitol’s profit this year,
meaning its shareholder equity dropped to $30.7bn in 2024 from $32.5bn a year
earlier. But it is still more than double the $13.4bn in total equity that it
held in 2021.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Vitol has also used its profits in the past three years to
acquire assets, including the largest refinery in the Mediterranean, BP’s
retail fuel network in Turkey, and the South African downstream oil company,
Engen. The group now owns almost 10,000 petrol stations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This year, Vitol announced a $1.65bn deal to acquire part of
an oil project in Ivory Coast and an LNG development in the Democratic Republic
of Congo.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The annual share buybacks are paid on top of salaries and
bonuses. Those are recorded under total personnel costs, which were $2.1bn last
year, down from $2.3bn in 2023, the filings show.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It has begun further payouts this year with $1.7bn in
employee share buybacks as of June. Vitol declined to comment.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
