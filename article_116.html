currency derivatives after clients suffered heavy losses linked to President
Donald Trump’s so-called “liberation day” tariff announcements.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Swiss bank told advisers to stop pitching the structured
forex products — known as Range Target Profit Forwards (RTPFs) — to many
clients, according to three people familiar with the discussions, amid growing
concerns about sales practices and whether the products were suitable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">UBS has already made more than 100 “goodwill” payments to
customers who lost money when the US dollar moved sharply in the wake of
Trump’s April tariff announcements.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The bank is now running internal role-play sessions to
improve how advisers assess client risk profiles and suitability, one of the
people said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The tone at internal meetings has completely changed in the
past few months,” the person added. “Now it’s all about risk assessment, not
boasting about how many clients you got to sign up to these things, which have
lucrative fees.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">One UBS client said his adviser had stressed that such
products should now be reserved for only the most sophisticated clients with
far greater scrutiny of suitability.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The person said his adviser who had marketed the products
had become far more cautious. “This time, my adviser didn’t bring any paperwork
— just wanted to talk. He said they’ve been told to stop pushing these.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Another person familiar with the situation added the bank
was still selling the products, but in much smaller volumes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">RTPFs are designed for professional investors with a high
risk tolerance and are restricted or tightly regulated in many jurisdictions,
including the UK, Spain and several Asian markets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The products offer limited upside but expose clients to
potentially unlimited losses. The ones at issue in UBS’s case involved
regularly exchanging US dollars for Swiss francs at a fixed rate, provided the
exchange rate stayed within a defined range.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But when the dollar dropped sharply after Trump’s tariffs,
many clients were forced to continue trading on increasingly unfavourable
terms, leading to steep and unexpected financial damage.</p><p class="MsoNormal">UBS said it was taking the matter seriously and has
contacted clients who suffered “unexpected effects.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">A person familiar with the matter confirmed that UBS was in
discussions with about two dozen clients and legal representatives. The bank is
also reviewing the conduct of six client advisers who sold the products to
clients who may not have fully understood the risks, they said.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
