regulators should continue to maintain supplementary leverage ratios at “global
systemically important banks” is well founded. These too-big-to-fail banks will
play an increasingly important role in these rapidly changing economic times
where, for example, $1tn or more could be withdrawn from banks and other
investments and used to buy unproductive bitcoins.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However another, more basic, change — requiring lenders to
sell all loans “with recourse” — could drastically reduce risk and would
revolutionise the lending industry at very low cost to regulators. Any loan
that went sour would have to be repurchased by the seller of that loan.
Alternatively they could substitute a comparable “performing” loan.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This approach would ensure that each lender, including both
the originator and the packager of loans, acted prudently. It could prevent or
at least mitigate future meltdowns.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Michael Westgate Former Assistant to the Director, FDLIC
