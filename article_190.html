Reserve chair Jay Powell?</p><p class="MsoNormal">First of all, it’s essential to say that this would be a
major achievement for the president. Even if House of Representatives speaker
Mike Johnson isn’t clear on the legality of firing Powell, most legal experts
are. It is widely understood that Powell cannot be fired without cause (hence
Trump’s contingency plan in laying the groundwork for a fraud accusation). But
putting all that aside, and further parking the tidal wave of worry and stress
it would set off in financial markets, what could a Trump appointee do at the
Fed?</p><p class="MsoNormal">The chair’s powers derive largely from tradition rather than
law, and in particular from a tradition of agreement among members of both the
board of governors (BoG) and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The BoG
is a body of seven members located in Washington, appointed by the president
and approved by the senate. The FOMC, which we think of as making monetary
policy decisions, is made up of the members of the BoG plus the president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four other rotating regional reserve
bank presidents. Unanimous votes on the FOMC are the norm in recent history,
reflecting the committee's tendency to follow the leader.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Assuming this behaviour continued and he (and let’s be
honest, it'll be a him) could marshal the votes of the BoG, then a new
Trump-appointed chair would have a range of significant powers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">First, he would be able to determine the interest rate that
the Fed pays on reserves (not to mention reserve requirements). This is the
primary mechanism through which it conducts interest rate policy. Traditionally
this rate is set downstream of FOMC decisions about target rates, but it is
technically within the purview of the BoG to set it. In other words, Trump’s
appointee could direct interest rate policy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Second, he could hire the Fed’s general counsel. It is the
general counsel’s job to tell the BoG what they can (and cannot) legally do.
The willingness of this person to stretch traditional legal boundaries could do
more than almost anything else to enable the powers of a radical Fed chair.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Third, he would be able to review the appointment of
regional Fed presidents. Traditionally, the BoG has largely rubber-stamped
regional board choices, but they could influence this process to secure
friendly additions to the FOMC. If Trump’s new chair wanted to print money to
build a wall on the Mexican Border, for instance, they'd need the votes on the
FOMC to deploy balance sheet policy to do so. This would be one way to get
them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Finally, if a Trump-appointed Fed chair could control the
votes of the FOMC, he could determine which countries have access to swap
lines, and on what terms. Swap lines are the lifeblood of the entire global
financial system. It’s hard to imagine a greater source of leverage for the
administration.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The $6.6tn question is whether a Trump appointee at the Fed
would be able to marshal the votes of the BoG to do what he wanted. The current
BoG looks unlikely to play ball. With the exception of Michelle Bowman and
Chris Waller, the other five members were appointed by, or worked for, Joe
Biden or Barack Obama, and most of them have long terms ahead of them. While
the BoG is unlikely to be interested in supporting some of Trump’s more radical
central bank policy ideas, it is a whole different matter if they'd be willing
to act equally as radically to stop him. In other words, the BoG could block a
Trump-appointed chair from taking radical action, but to do so, it would have
to violate some very well-established norms. They'd have to vote against the
chair, itself unusual, and perhaps have to deploy some of their formal powers
that are traditionally not exercised — influencing regional president
appointments or pushing back against the Chair on swap lines or general counsel
appointments.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But of course, if Trump did manage to fire Powell, there is
nothing to say he wouldn't succeed in firing the whole BoG and replacing them
all with loyalists. And in that case, there would be nothing to stop a Trump
Fed from printing money to build a wall, crashing the international economy by
eliminating swap lines, and much more. Nothing, that is, except Congress. So
yet again, Congress marshalling and exerting its own powers may be the only
obstacle to Trump’s over-reach. I'm not hugely optimistic.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The writer is a research fellow at the University of
