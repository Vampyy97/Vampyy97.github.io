style='font-style:normal'>Before dawn in the US on Saturday, plane spotters
using flight tracker apps noticed B-2 stealth bombers based in Missouri flying
to the Pacific, sparking speculation they were heading to Guam to prepare for
an attack on Iran.<br>
As experts debated why the B-2s were flying towards Guam and not Diego Garcia,
an Indian Ocean location closer to Iran where the US and UK have a base, the US
was already conducting a top-secret attack on Iran.<br>
Very early on Saturday eastern time, seven other B-2s took off from Whiteman
Air Force Base in Missouri. Unlike the planes that flew to the Pacific and made
themselves detectable at times, the seven B-2s flew east in stealth mode.
Roughly 18 hours later, they dropped 14 massive bunker-buster bombs on two of
Iran’s three nuclear sites that were hit in the strikes.<br>
After the strikes on Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, US defence secretary Pete
Hegseth said Operation Midnight Ham­mer involved very tight operational
security and “misdirection”.<br>
“The scope and scale of what occurred . . . would take the breath away of
almost any American if you had an opportunity to watch it in real time,”
Hegseth said. “Tehran is certainly calcu­lating the reality that planes flew
from the middle of America ... completely undetected over three of their most
highly sensitive sites and we were able to destroy nuclear capabilities.”<br>
Hegseth was flanked by General Dan “Razin” Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs
of staff, who said the B-2 bombers that flew west to the Pacific were a “decoy”
designed to ensure “tactical surprise”. Caine said the “deception effort [was]
known only to an extremely small number of planners and key lead­ers” in
Washington and at US Central Command, which oversees US forces in the Middle
East.Mark Kimmitt, former deputy direc­tor for strategy and plans at Centcom,
said the operational security was impressive. “In my years in the military and
government, I never saw it this tight.” Doug Birkey, head of the Mitchell
Institute for Aerospace Studies, said the bombers used a “conceal-reveal”
tactic with some planes making themselves detectable, while others stayed
stealth.<br>
Caine said the strikes started at 12.30am Sunday in Iran when a US sub­marine
launched 24 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Isfahan as the B-2s entered Iranian
airspace. The B-2s hit their tar­gets between 2.10am and 2.35am. Shortly
afterwards, the Tomahawks reached Isfahan — timed to ensure the B-2s maintained
an element of surprise.<br>
<br>
Caine said the bombers and their accompanying refuelling aircraft and fighter
jets — known as the “strike pack­age” — had flown in and out of Iranian
airspace without corning under any fire.“This was a carefully crafted mission
which utilised significant operational deception, notably, sending a decoy set
of B-2 bombers to Guam,” said James Stavridis, a former US supreme allied
commander in Europe. “The media fix­ated on the Guam movement, and I suspect it
made the Iranians think they had another few days.”<br>
<br>
Joseph Votel, who commanded Cent­com for the first two years of Donald Trump’s
first presidency, said flying B-2s from Missouri enhanced secrecy. “By
deploying directly from the US, the joint force was doing everything it could
to minimise detection, which is very smart,” he said.Kimmitt said sending B-2s
to Guam was a “nice little head fake”, but that the key strategic deception
came earlier. “The ultimate deception was Trump laying down a two-week timeline
for negotiations and then attacking Iran three days later, a classic Trojan
horse,” he said. On Thursday, Trump gave Tehran a “maximum” of two weeks to
reach a nuclear deal with the US, sug­gesting that a strike was not imminent.
Two days later, the US struck the three Iranian nuclear facilities.But there
were signs Trump had made his decision, even if he had not given the order, by
Thursday. Three people famil­iar with the situation said he left leaders at the
G7 in Canada last weekend with the impression he would strike Iran.<br>
<br>
They said he had presented options to other leaders. A fourth person said he
told the group de-escalation had not and would not work. He told the leaders
that any attack would involve one run against Iran. “It was clear to me that he
was already preparing his talking points,” said one of the people.However,
following the G7, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Trump said
“nothing... to suggest he’s about to get involved in this conflict”.<br>
When the UK, France, Germany and the EU held talks with Iran on Friday, UK
foreign secretary David Lammy was unaware of the imminent attack. But he tried
to convince Iran it could not afford to slow-walk negotiations with Wash­ington,
according to one person close to the talks.<br>
Several people said Trump seemed to have been convinced the risks had been
significantly reduced since Israel had degraded Iran’s air defences with its
attacks prior to the US mission.<br>
Underscoring the secrecy, Hegseth said the administration notified Con­gress
after the attack. However, a spokesperson for Republican House Speaker Mike
Johnson said he was briefed before the strikes.<br>
The US gave no notice to most allies. The US did co-ordinate with Israel,
according to the Israeli government.<br>
<br>
The US and Israel also engaged in co­ordinated deception ahead of Israel
launching its attack on Iran on June 13. Leaks to the Israeli media suggested
that Netanyahu and Trump had held a fractious phone call over Iran with Trump
pushing for a diplomatic solution, which one person familiar with the call said
was an attempt to dupe Tehran.</span></span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Israel hits Tehran’s Evin prison as strikes intensify</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Israel launched air strikes on Tehran’s notorious Evin
prison yesterday, caus­ing panic and chaos among inmates in one of the worst
days of bombing on Iran since the war began this month.</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><img border=0 width=417 height=235
src=" image003.jpg"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Israel escalated its attacks on Tehran and
the nearby city of Karaj, claiming it targeted military bases and the entrance
gate of Evin prison, which houses political prisoners, activists and foreigners
accused of espionage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iranian media reported that a sepa­rate
electricity facility was also hit, resulting in several hours of power out­ages
in some neighbourhoods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The strike on Evin — which came as Iran
launched its own round of strikes on Israel — shocked the public.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Many residents viewed it as a sign of
Israel’s lack of restraint, though Iranian opposition overseas claimed that the
prison was hit as a symbol of the regime’s repression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sajedeh Arabsorkhi, a social activist
formerly imprisoned on charges of “propaganda against the Islamic repub­lic”,
spoke out about the targeting of Evin. “The area near the entrance is usually
busy, not just with guards but also with people brought in for initial judicial
processing,” she told the Finan­cial Times. “Prison is like a hospital. Those
inside are helpless. How can Israel justify striking prisoners who can­not even
flee? Claiming this is about tar­geting a symbol of the regime ... is deceitful
and shameful.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>According to a source familiar with the
incident, Israeli intelligence sent dozens of text and phone messages in Farsi
to senior officials at Evin prior to the air strike, reportedly warning them to
evacuate and release dissidents held inside. Calls were also made to the offi­cials’
family members.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The source indicated the strike was
intended to avoid harming prisoners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iranian state television confirmed damage
to the prison’s entrance and aired footage of what it said was debris inside
the prison — including a damaged 48-bed hospital — as rescue workers carried
injured and recovered bodies from beneath the rubble. Authorities did not
release any casualty figures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iran’s judiciary confirmed that the prison
was damaged but said that “the situation is under control”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Evin was built before the 1979 Islamic
Revolution but became a site for detain­ing political opponents of the Islamic
regime, including journalists, intellec­tuals, and activists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The number of inmates held there remains
unclear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Leading political prisoner Mostafa Tajzadeh
was able to send a message to his wife yesterday assuring her of his safety.
State television also broadcast footage showing other prisoners making phone
calls to reassure their families.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Since the start of Israel’s war against
Iran on June 13, it has reportedly killed at least 17 senior military
commanders and a dozen nuclear scientists. Iran’s health ministry says 430
people have been killed and 3,500 injured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Israeli officials say 24 of its citizens
have been killed and more than 1,000 injured in Iranian strikes.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Gulf allies feel sidelined and nervous following US
strikes on nuclear sites</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>States that feted president are left to ponder the risk of
wider war and their own impotence</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=275 height=247
src=" image004.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>LONDON Donald Trump’s decision to join
Israel’s military campaign against Iran has shaken Gulf capitals that only
weeks ago rolled out the red carpet for the US pres­ident and urged him to hold
fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>While Gulf leaders last month feted Trump
with pageantry and trillion-dol­lar investment pledges, behind the scenes the
monarchies pressed him to stick to diplomacy with Tehran and avoid a regional
war they believe would threaten their security and stability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iran has long been a major political and
military rival to the Gulf’s largest economies — Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates — but they have sought to build bridges in recent years and the
eruption of a volatile new con­flict has unnerved the oil and gas states.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Gulf waters that separate Iran from its
Arab neighbours are narrow —</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>just 200 miles across at the widest point
and less than 50 at the tightest. Well within reach of Iran’s short-range mis­siles,
and playing host to key US military bases, Gulf nations desperately want to
avoid being dragged into the conflict.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But Gulf leaders also fear a prolonged
conflict will destabilise Iran, a multi­ethnic state of some 90mn people, or
push its rulers to take drastic action, such as seeking a nuclear weapon. Both
would leave the Gulf to deal with the chaotic aftermath of a war they neither
started nor supported.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“The last time we saw war in the Mid­dle
East, we saw the fragmentation of the region,” said Albadr Alshateri, pro­fessor
at the National Defence College in Abu Dhabi, citing the 2003 US-led inva­sion
of Iraq which he said caused “irrep­arable damage”. The ensuing mayhem
empowered Iran, inflamed sectarian tensions in the region and led to the birth
of Sunni jihadist group Isis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Although Alshateri judged the Ira­nian
regime’s immediate fall to be unlikely, he pointed to the experience of carnage
caused by attempts to collapse regimes in the wider Middle East. He</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>added that for the Gulf, “this is closer”.
Initial reaction to the US strikes was marked by anxiety and apprehension.
Citizens on Sunday morning felt “a mix of shock and concern,” said Eyad
Alrefai, faculty member of King Abdulaziz University’s political science depart­ment
in Saudi Arabia. “Social media platforms are flooded with urgent dis­cussions,”
he added. “The atmosphere is charged with emotions”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In Kuwait, the closest Gulf state to Iran
physically, people had reacted on a “spectrum”, said a Kuwaiti consultant,
“from those who are in denial that any­thing will ever come our way to those
who are in total hoarding panic”. The state’s finance ministry reassured
employees its complex had shelters equipped to fit 900 people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As British Airways became the latest
western carrier to suspend flights to Dubai and Doha, two expatriate work­ers
in Qatar said they had heard of par­ents keeping children home from school
while some families had departed for summer holidays early. And while nuclear
monitors around the region told the public that there was no change in</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>radiation levels, Bahrain sent 70 per cent
of civil servants home, activated remote learning for schools and urged
motorists to avoid main roads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The campaign against Iran under­scores how
Israel’s military operations are frustrating the Gulf’s desire to focus on its
own economic development. Gulf analysts argue Israel’s ambitions extend well
beyond Iran. “Look at what they’re doing today within their direct environ­ment,”
said Bader Al-Saif, assistant pro­fessor at Kuwait University, listing</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Israel’s military action in Lebanon, Syria
and Iraq. “What if they come out victorious with Iran? They’ll be dictat­ing
the show in the region and we can’t accept this.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For the past week, the region’s leaders
have condemned Israel’s offensive on their longtime rival, stayed in close con­tact
with Tehran and called for a return to talks between Iran and the Trump
administration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Gulf monarchies have forbidden the US from
launching attacks on Iran from bases on their shores. Diplomats and analysts
say they strongly advised Washington against such a move, alarmed that it would
even leave Gulf states as targets of Iranian retaliation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the UAE
have had a stormy relationship with Tehran. After Trump raised pres­sure on
Iran in his first term, officials in Tehran warned they would damage the United
Arab Emirates’ economy and frighten away expatriate workers. Iran was blamed
for attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf and energy infrastructure in Saudi
Arabia in 2019.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But the attacks elicited what the Gulf</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>saw as a lackluster US response, sowing
doubt about the steadfastness of US security commitment that pushed sev­eral
states towards seeking rapproche­ment with Tehran. After several years of
defusing tension, “the relationship between the Arab side and the Iranians is
at its best”, said Alshateri.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hasan Alhasan, Bahrain-based senior fellow
for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies,
said that for all the calls for urgent dialogue, the diplomatic sway of Gulf
states was limited in this crisis. “The best the Gulf states can do is be
prepared, signal their non-involvement to Iran and keep the offer of mediation
on the table,” Alhasan said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The apparent lack of influence on Trump’s
decisions comes despite the Gulf states’ efforts to burnish their rela­tionship
with the US since his return to power. Analysts argue Gulf-US relations remain
strong, and statements on Sun­day by Gulf countries were careful not to
criticise Trump’s intervention explic­itly. The only exception was Oman, the
facilitator of US-Iran nuclear talks, which attacked the strikes as “illegal”.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>UK-France migrant deal stokes anger</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Mediterranean states fear having to take back asylum
seekers if pact is sealed</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Italy, Spain and three other southern EU
countries have criticised a proposed Franco-British migration deal, arguing it
could leave them having to take back people returned from the UK to the
continent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The five nations, which also include
Greece, Malta and Cyprus, have sent a letter to the European Commission, seen
by the Financial Times, objecting to France negotiating an arrangement to swap
asylum seekers with Britain in a bid to deter migrants from crossing the
Channel in boats.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We take note — with a degree of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>surprise — of the reported intention of
France to sign a bilateral readmission arrangement,” the letter reads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“If confirmed, such an initiative raises
serious concerns for us, both procedur­ally and in terms of potential implica­tions
for other member states, particu­larly those of first entry,” they wrote in the
letter sent last week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The precise terms of the FrancoBritish deal
remain unclear, but the principle would be to return irregular migrants to
France while Britain accepted asylum seekers seeking resettlement. Such swaps
were first attempted in the EU’s migration deal with Turkey to stem boat
crossings to Greece.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A British official admitted that “the final
hurdles are taking longer than expected” as some EU countries “are more onboard
than others”. French</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>President Emmanuel Macron is due to visit
London on July 8.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As part of the “reset” agreement signed in
May, the EU and the UK pledged to work on “practical and inno­vative
approaches” to reduce irregular migration. But divisions within the EU and
demands from the UK prevented a wider agreement on migration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The UK has instead pushed for bilat­eral
agreements with European capitals on the issue of “small boats”. In the year to
March, 38,000 people crossed the Channel, according to the government.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Mediterranean group objected to France
negotiating the deal with the UK bilaterally, rather than as a part of the
EU-UK “reset” deal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The five signatories — often the first port
of call for people making the jour­ney from Africa — are concerned the ini­tiative
would mean France would, using</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>EU rules, return asylum seekers to the
first country of entry, where their asy­lum claim should be processed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We believe it is essential to clarify
whether the agreement may produce any direct or indirect consequences for other
member states,” they wrote.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The letter comes after UK Prime Min­ister
Sir Keir Starmer sought advice from Italy’s premier, Giorgia Meloni, on curbing
irregular migration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One EU official said that there had been “a
very strong front on the side of the EU that there is no cherry picking” in the
negotiations with the UK, and they were disappointed that the issue had been
exempted from this. “We would have preferred it to be in the context of our
joint negotiations.” <i>Additional reporting by Anna Gross in London, Adrienne

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Germany frets over its big defence budget</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Funding reaches €650bn but notorious red tape hampers overhaul
of neglected military</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=483 height=288

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>After Germany’s new government this week
granted defence minister Boris Pistorius a staggering €650bn for the next five
years to overhaul the country’s long-neglected armed forces, his main challenge
will be spending it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Pistorius must grapple with a pro­curement
bureaucracy that once took seven years to select a new main assault rifle and
more than a decade to procure a helmet for helicopter pilots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He will have to oversee an enormous
expansion by an arms industry already struggling with capacity. And billions
must go towards tasks such as upgrad­ing barracks, some of which are in “dis­astrous”
shape with crumbling plaster and mould, according to the armed forces watchdog.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Pistorius said this week the country could
“finally procure what we need” after Berlin announced Germany’s defence budget
would reach €162bn by 2029 when support for Ukraine is included — up 70 per cent
on this year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But he warned: “All of this presup­poses
that industrial production capac­ity can now be ramped up quickly, scaled up
and adapted to our needs and our orders.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Germany is on track to meet Nato’s new
target of spending 3.5 per cent of GDP on core defence by 2029 — six years
ahead of the western military alliance’s newly agreed deadline. Spurred by Pres­ident
Donald Trump’s threat to pull US security guarantees from the continent,
European nations have agreed to invest more in their own armies. They are also
seeking to deter aggression from Rus­sia’s President Vladimir Putin as his
invasion of Ukraine grinds on into its fourth year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>German military planners must spend tens of
billions on air defence sys­tems, long-range weapons, armoured vehicles and
cyber warfare to meet their new Nato commitments. They also want to develop
satellite systems to boost Europe’s intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance capabilities. “Europeans are racing to fill the gap but it’s a
big ask,” said Ben Schreer, of the Interna­tional Institute for Strategic
Studies. “It will take time and cost a lot of money.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Berlin seeks to grow its professional armed
forces from around 180,000 troops to 260,000 by the mid-2030s. Many experts
believe Germany, which plans to introduce voluntary military service, will
ultimately have to adopt a compulsory model. The Munich-based Ifo Institute
estimates that would cost the government €3.2bn a year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Germany has already made progress in
overhauling the Bundeswehr since Putin’s Ukraine invasion in 2022, when then
chancellor Olaf Scholz unveiled a €100bn special fund for equipping the
military. The head of the army warned then his troops were “more or less
empty-handed”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spending on a whole new scale comes after
new chancellor Friedrich Merz’s decision to allow unlimited borrowing to
re-establish Germany as Europe’s strongest conventional army. But spending
large sums will create huge</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>challenges for Germany’s defence pro­curement
system. The vast Bundeswehr procurement office in Koblenz, with 11,800
employees, was notorious in the past for fastidiously following national and EU
regulations and drawing up complicated custom requirements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The finance ministry in Berlin was another
barrier, with officials with no military expertise debating how many submarines
the navy really needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Pistorius has already had some suc­cess in
changing the culture, calling for speed instead of what he has called
“gold-plated solutions”. Germany has used the €100bn to order a string of
bigticket items including F-35 fighter jets, Chinook helicopters and an Arrow 3
air defence system from Israel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yet frustrations remain. “Sometimes just
drawing up a contract can take an entire year,” said one senior official.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Even once products are ordered, sup­pliers
can be slow to deliver amid huge industry bottlenecks. “When you order a
Patriot [air defence] system today they say: thank you for your order, you will
receive it in 2028,” said the senior official in reference to the US system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Defence companies are excited at the
prospects. But they are also nervous about the challenge of dramatically
expanding production. “When you look at the numbers that are currently circu­lating
in Berlin, it’s almost something to be afraid of,” said an executive at a mid­sized
German weapons maker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Lessons from the Ukraine war, and how the
spoils of the defence budget should be shared, are open to debate. Armin
Papperger, chief executive of artillery and ammunition producer Rheinmetall,
believes “conventional war is back”. But Gundbert Scherf Helsing, co-founder of
AI developer and drone maker Helsing, said: “We’re still counting tanks, ships
and planes. That’s the wrong mindset.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Claudia Major, senior vice-president at the
German Marshall Fund, said it was a false dichotomy. “In the end, we need to
get the right mix, the mix adapted to Nato’s way of fighting — and we need to
get it quickly.”</span></p>

minerals part of USbacked peace plans for the region.</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Gentry Beach, the chair of investment firm
America First Global and former finance co-chair of Trump’s campaign in 2016,
is part of a consortium negotiat­ing for rights to the Rubaya coltan mine, said
Congolese officials and people familiar with the matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The mine, outside the city of Goma in
eastern DR Congo, has been at the cen­tre of the trade in smuggled coltan used
in the financing of one of Africa’s longest-running and deadliest wars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Rubaya, which produces about half of DR
Congo’s coltan, was captured in January by Rwandan-backed M23 rebels who have
since overseen and taxed its output. The mine is considered by geologists to be
one of the most commercially promising sources for the tantalum and niobium
used in the electronics industry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>People involved in the discussions hope, if
a deal is finalised, the mine will be part of a raft of US investment under­pinning
the Trump administration’s approach to ending the fighting between DR Congo,
Rwanda and proxy militias.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Foreign ministers of the warring par­ties
yesterday signed a US-brokered peace agreement in Washington. The US is
dangling the prospect of billions of dollars in US investment in mining and
infrastructure as key to persuading them to stop fighting, in an example of
Trump’s signature transactional style of diplomacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Rubaya was one of a number of assets
embattled DR Congo president </span><span lang=FR>Félix </span><span
lang=EN-US>Tshisekedi touted when he first approached Washington in February
offering mining rights in return for help in ending a rebellion in the
country’s east, according to Congolese officials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Both Washington and Kinshasa have expressed
hope that any deals will also dilute Chinese dominance in what is Africa’s
richest store of minerals. DR Congo accounts for about 70 per cent of the
world’s cobalt, as well as some of the continent’s largest reserves of gold,
copper, coltan, tin and diamonds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“When the US stepped in, theywanted to
frame their approach to a peace settlement differently than in the past,” said
one regional participant in the plans, on condition of anonymity. “They were
looking at what the business and economic side of the deal would be that allows
this region to prosper, so we don’t get back into this all over.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Beach, a former hedge fund manager and
long-standing college friend of Trump’s son, Donald Jr, has experience in DR
Congo dating back to a previous 2004 mining venture. Beach was also involved in
ventures in the DR Congo with late Congo-born basketballlegend Dikembe Mutombo.
Although Donald Jr and Beach are old college friends, the president’s son has
no involvement in Beach’s business ven­tures, according to a person close to
Donald Jr.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>America First Global, which declined to
comment, is part of a consortium including Swiss commodities group Mercuria
that hopes to develop the mine in a joint venture with Congolese state miner
Sakima. Mercuria, which also did not comment, would buy offtake from the mine,
which according to people involved could require in excess of $500mn in
investment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Rubaya is an important part of the peace
process ... We hope to dramati­cally expand it, reorganise it, and make it a
world-class example of how to do mining,” one participant of the consor­tium
said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Prospects for peace remain precari­ous and
it is still unclear how, were Rwanda to end its part in the conflict, the M23
rebels they have backed will be persuaded to relinquish Rubaya.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=427 height=257

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eric Trump has said that “the political
path” for a family dynasty “would be an easy one”, opening the door for another
Trump to seek office after his father leaves the White House.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>His comments came in a wide ranging
Financial Times interview, in which the co-executive vice-president of the
Trump Organization discussed his international real estate dealings, hit back
at criticism that the family is seek­ing to profit from the presidency and
echoed his father’s claims about political persecution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“The real question is: do you want to drag
other members of your family into it?” Eric Trump said. “Would I want my kids
to live the same experience over the last decade that I’ve lived? You know, if
the answer was yes, I think the political path would be an easy one, meaning, I
think I could do it.” He added: “And by the way, I think other members of our
family could do it too.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The 41-year-old, who grew up on the Trump
Tower’s top floor, has been considered less political than his older siblings,
instead focusing on the family business since Donald Trump’s first term began
in 2017.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>His older brother Donald Jr is a fre­quent
fundraiser and Maga podcaster, and his sister Ivanka took a role in the first
Trump White House, while his wife Lara was co-chair of the Republican National
Committee last year. But Eric Trump described himself as “wholly unimpressed by
half the politicians I see ... I could do it very effectively”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Vice-president JD Vance and secre­tary of
state Marco Rubio are seen as favourites for the 2028 Republican nomination.
But as to whether a family member would run, Eric Trump said: “Who knows?”
Asked whether2024will be the last election with a Trump on the ballot, he said:
“I don’t know . .. Time will tell. But there’s more people than just me.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He added: “The question is, do you want to
do it? And do you want to sub­ject the people that you love to the brutality of
this system? And I’m not sure if I can answer that question yet.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>While critics say the second Trump term has
been marked by the presi­dent’s personal involvement in money­ raising
endeavours, the family has often depicted itself as persecuted by a hostile
establishment. “If there’s one family that hasn’t profited off politics, it’s
the Trump family,” Eric Trump said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“In fact, I would sit there and say that we
[would have] had many more zeros behind our name had my father not run in the
first place. The opportunity cost, the legal cost, the toll it’s taken on our
family has been astronomical.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He said the Trump family had spent close to
$500mn “just defending our­selves from Russia shams, fake hoaxes, dirty
dossiers about the unthinkable”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In 2024, a New York judge ordered Donald
Trump and the Trump Organization to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in
penalties after censuring them for “blatantly false financial data”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Donald Jr and Eric Trump were ordered to
pay more than $4mn each and individually barred from doing business in New York
state for two years. The case is being appealed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The family waded into the social media
industry after Donald Trump was barred from Facebook and Twitter fol­lowing the
January 6 2021 attack on the US Capitol, which led him to create his Truth
Social network.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The president’s stake in its parent company
Trump Media &amp; Technology Group is now worth about $2bn on paper, while the
family’s crypto hold­ings may rival its real estate portfolio.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>According to Eric Trump, the family
embraced crypto after being shunned by traditional finance. He now describes it
as a “very profitable venture”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>TMTG has raised $2.5bn to buy bit­coin.
Trump’s World Liberty Financial has also said that an Emirati stateowned
investment firm had used its stablecoin to invest $2bn in Binance. The
president issued his $TRUMP meme­coins days before his return to office and
rewarded top holders with a dinner at his golf course in Virginia last month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eric Trump himself launched crypto mining
company American Bitcoin. He called bitcoin the “gold asset in the mod­ern
era”, saying the cryptocurrency is “better than gold” — “tradeable 24/7”,
“transportable”, “digital”, “immediate” and in limited supply. By contrast, he
told a crypto conference in Las Vegas last month that he “would love to see
some of the big banks go extinct”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>His father, who dismissed crypto in 2019 as
“highly volatile”, “based on thin air” and a facilitator of illegal activity,
is now leading a charge in Washington to boost the industry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>At the same time Eric Trump, who says the
Trump Organization is worth $8bn-$12bn, is striking real estate deals across
the world, despite a pledge the group made ahead of his father’s first term to
avoid new foreign ventures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We got absolutely no credit for doing it,
and we’ve done everything right,” he added, referring to the pledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I’m really busy and my father’s try­ing to
stop world war three,” he said. “My father has nothing to do with com­panies;
he’s not running any of our enti­ties. I run great hotels around the world.
It’s what I’ve done my entire life; I started on our construction jobs when I
was 11 years old. It’s all I’ve ever known.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eric Trump said he was working on “several”
hotels in India. A group con­nected to Mukesh Ambani, India’s rich­est man,
paid a $10mn “development fee” to the Trump Organization. “Pick the five
biggest cities [in India], and we’re going to be there,” he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But, noting the role of geopolitics in
potential deals, he said if there were “true political stability” he would
enter the Israeli market and has had “a hun­dred” opportunities to enter China.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Our brand is hugely popular in China,” he
said. “In the middle of tariffs and trade wars, it’s just not the right time,
right?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Reza Kianian, a veteran award-winning
Iranian actor, has long been a vocal domestic critic of the Islamic republic,
using his popular Instagram page to question tenets of the regime’s ideology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yet when Israel launched its deadly assault
on Iran this month, Kianian swiftly joined the ranks of regime critics rallying
around the flag, part of the surge of patriotic fervour that has swept the
country of 90mn since the 12-day war started. “Iran has existed, exists still,
and will endure,” Kianian said on Instagram after the war began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This newfound sense of unity in the
otherwise polarised country surprised observers and pohticians both at home and
abroad. While Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu sought to tap disillusion­ment by
calling on people to rise up against the Islamic republic, even hard­ened
regime opponents temporarily set aside their criticisms and recoiled against
what they saw as a war against not just their rulers but Iran itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“One person sitting outside Iran can­not
tell a nation to rise up,” Kianian, 74, told the Financial Times. “Iran is my
country. I will decide what to do, and won’t wait for you to tell me what to do
in my own country.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This reawakening of Iranian national­ism
—which politicians hope will persist even if anger towards the Islamic repubHc
returns to the surface — comes after decades of deep polarisation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iran’s theocratic rulers have long
attempted to suppress an increasingly secular nation’s yearning for economic,
political and social change, responding to unrest with brutal crackdowns.
Amnesty International said more than 300 were killed during protests in 2022
triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, for not
properly wearing a hijab, leaving deep scars on the nation’s psyche.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Though the Islamic republic has since
relaxed its hijab rules, many Iranians are deeply unhappy with the state of the
economy, struggling to cope with infla­tion and US sanctions, and angry at
alleged corruption among those with regime links. Yet when Israel launched its
offensive on June 13, Iranians decided this was not the moment of change they
had hoped for. Many were shaken by the bombardment, which Israel said was aimed
at regime targets but which Iranian officials said killed 627 people and
destroyed 120 residen­tial buildings in Tehran before ending in a fragile
ceasefire on Tuesday. Israeli officials said Iran’s missiles killed 28 people
in Israel and hit residential areas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We felt stuck between forces who only
sought their own ambitions, rather than our wellbeing,” said Maryam, a
39year-old housewife and regime critic, still furious over the deaths in the
2022 protests. Netanyahu reminded us that we could even lose the little we
have. In this sense, he inadvertently served the Islamic repubhc, making us
less hopeful of being able to get rid of this regime.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>To avoid provoking a popular back­lash, the
regime played down its polaris­ing ideology, in which the US and Israel are
eternal enemies and Shia Islam the solution to all problems. Banners put up in
Tehran sought to promote national­ism rather than regime talking points, and
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday praised what he called
the country’s “extraordi­nary unity”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“A nation of 90mn was united and resisted
with one voice, standing shoul­der to shoulder without raising their dif­ferences,”
he said in a video message, which focused on Iran as a nation rather than the
ruling theocracy, clearly aim­ing to keep Iranians united. “It became clear
that in critical times, one voice is heard from the nation.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Officials sought to prolong this patri­otism
by hailing the conflict as a “vic­tory”, despite the devastating blows to the
regime, military and Iran’s nuclear programme. “Let’s not forget there were no
anti-war protests in the streets and the government made sure there was
sufficient supply of food and fuel every­where,” one regime insider said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The war appears, for the time being at
least, to have boosted some domestic support for Iran’s ballistic missile pro­gramme,
the government’s crackdown on alleged Israeli collaborators and even enthusiasm
for acquiring a nuclear bomb, something the Islamic republic says it is not
pursuing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yet maintaining this unity will not be
easy, with critics of the regime calling for a reckoning over the Islamic republic’s
role in setting Iran on a path to war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kianian said hardliners within the regime,
including on state television, should be held accountable for the extent to
which their policies contrib­uted to the conflict.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hardliners have repeatedly said Israel
should be wiped off the map and that support for militant proxies like Hizbol­lah
in Lebanon should continue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“They keep saying on television that we are
all together, from left to right,” he said. “It took them too long to realise
that we are united, and only when there was no other choice during wartime did
they say it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>To many Iranians, the Islamic republic
should not take this national solidar­ity for granted and double down on divi­sive
policies, with issues that have enraged Iranians continuing to fester.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“What has saved Iran is not a delu­sional
ideology but its ancient his­tory ... and the experience of surviving invasions
by Alexander, the Mongols and the Arabs,” Fayyaz Zahed, a reform­ist political
analyst, said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Perhaps only history teachers in the
country could foresee this . . . Once again, we realised that if there is ever
going to be any change, it can only come from within.”</span></p>
