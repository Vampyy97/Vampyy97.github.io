style='font-style:normal'>Before dawn in the US on Saturday, plane spotters
using flight tracker apps noticed B-2 stealth bombers based in Missouri flying
to the Pacific, sparking speculation they were heading to Guam to prepare for
an attack on Iran.<br>
As experts debated why the B-2s were flying towards Guam and not Diego Garcia,
an Indian Ocean location closer to Iran where the US and UK have a base, the US
was already conducting a top-secret attack on Iran.<br>
Very early on Saturday eastern time, seven other B-2s took off from Whiteman
Air Force Base in Missouri. Unlike the planes that flew to the Pacific and made
themselves detectable at times, the seven B-2s flew east in stealth mode.
Roughly 18 hours later, they dropped 14 massive bunker-buster bombs on two of
Iran’s three nuclear sites that were hit in the strikes.<br>
After the strikes on Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, US defence secretary Pete
Hegseth said Operation Midnight Ham­mer involved very tight operational
security and “misdirection”.<br>
“The scope and scale of what occurred . . . would take the breath away of
almost any American if you had an opportunity to watch it in real time,”
Hegseth said. “Tehran is certainly calcu­lating the reality that planes flew
from the middle of America ... completely undetected over three of their most
highly sensitive sites and we were able to destroy nuclear capabilities.”<br>
Hegseth was flanked by General Dan “Razin” Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs
of staff, who said the B-2 bombers that flew west to the Pacific were a “decoy”
designed to ensure “tactical surprise”. Caine said the “deception effort [was]
known only to an extremely small number of planners and key lead­ers” in
Washington and at US Central Command, which oversees US forces in the Middle
East.Mark Kimmitt, former deputy direc­tor for strategy and plans at Centcom,
said the operational security was impressive. “In my years in the military and
government, I never saw it this tight.” Doug Birkey, head of the Mitchell
Institute for Aerospace Studies, said the bombers used a “conceal-reveal” tactic
with some planes making themselves detectable, while others stayed stealth.<br>
Caine said the strikes started at 12.30am Sunday in Iran when a US sub­marine
launched 24 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Isfahan as the B-2s entered Iranian
airspace. The B-2s hit their tar­gets between 2.10am and 2.35am. Shortly
afterwards, the Tomahawks reached Isfahan — timed to ensure the B-2s maintained
an element of surprise.<br>
<br>
Caine said the bombers and their accompanying refuelling aircraft and fighter
jets — known as the “strike pack­age” — had flown in and out of Iranian
airspace without corning under any fire.“This was a carefully crafted mission
which utilised significant operational deception, notably, sending a decoy set
of B-2 bombers to Guam,” said James Stavridis, a former US supreme allied
commander in Europe. “The media fix­ated on the Guam movement, and I suspect it
made the Iranians think they had another few days.”<br>
<br>
Joseph Votel, who commanded Cent­com for the first two years of Donald Trump’s
first presidency, said flying B-2s from Missouri enhanced secrecy. “By
deploying directly from the US, the joint force was doing everything it could
to minimise detection, which is very smart,” he said.Kimmitt said sending B-2s
to Guam was a “nice little head fake”, but that the key strategic deception
came earlier. “The ultimate deception was Trump laying down a two-week timeline
for negotiations and then attacking Iran three days later, a classic Trojan
horse,” he said. On Thursday, Trump gave Tehran a “maximum” of two weeks to
reach a nuclear deal with the US, sug­gesting that a strike was not imminent.
Two days later, the US struck the three Iranian nuclear facilities.But there
were signs Trump had made his decision, even if he had not given the order, by
Thursday. Three people famil­iar with the situation said he left leaders at the
G7 in Canada last weekend with the impression he would strike Iran.<br>
<br>
They said he had presented options to other leaders. A fourth person said he
told the group de-escalation had not and would not work. He told the leaders
that any attack would involve one run against Iran. “It was clear to me that he
was already preparing his talking points,” said one of the people.However,
following the G7, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Trump said
“nothing... to suggest he’s about to get involved in this conflict”.<br>
When the UK, France, Germany and the EU held talks with Iran on Friday, UK
foreign secretary David Lammy was unaware of the imminent attack. But he tried
to convince Iran it could not afford to slow-walk negotiations with Wash­ington,
according to one person close to the talks.<br>
Several people said Trump seemed to have been convinced the risks had been
significantly reduced since Israel had degraded Iran’s air defences with its
attacks prior to the US mission.<br>
Underscoring the secrecy, Hegseth said the administration notified Con­gress
after the attack. However, a spokesperson for Republican House Speaker Mike
Johnson said he was briefed before the strikes.<br>
The US gave no notice to most allies. The US did co-ordinate with Israel,
according to the Israeli government.<br>
<br>
The US and Israel also engaged in co­ordinated deception ahead of Israel
launching its attack on Iran on June 13. Leaks to the Israeli media suggested
that Netanyahu and Trump had held a fractious phone call over Iran with Trump
pushing for a diplomatic solution, which one person familiar with the call said
was an attempt to dupe Tehran.</span></span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Israel hits Tehran’s Evin prison as strikes intensify</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Israel launched air strikes on Tehran’s notorious Evin
prison yesterday, caus­ing panic and chaos among inmates in one of the worst
days of bombing on Iran since the war began this month.</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><img border=0 width=417 height=235
src=" image003.jpg"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Israel escalated its attacks on Tehran and
the nearby city of Karaj, claiming it targeted military bases and the entrance
gate of Evin prison, which houses political prisoners, activists and foreigners
accused of espionage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iranian media reported that a sepa­rate
electricity facility was also hit, resulting in several hours of power out­ages
in some neighbourhoods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The strike on Evin — which came as Iran
launched its own round of strikes on Israel — shocked the public.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Many residents viewed it as a sign of
Israel’s lack of restraint, though Iranian opposition overseas claimed that the
prison was hit as a symbol of the regime’s repression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sajedeh Arabsorkhi, a social activist
formerly imprisoned on charges of “propaganda against the Islamic repub­lic”,
spoke out about the targeting of Evin. “The area near the entrance is usually
busy, not just with guards but also with people brought in for initial judicial
processing,” she told the Finan­cial Times. “Prison is like a hospital. Those
inside are helpless. How can Israel justify striking prisoners who can­not even
flee? Claiming this is about tar­geting a symbol of the regime ... is deceitful
and shameful.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>According to a source familiar with the
incident, Israeli intelligence sent dozens of text and phone messages in Farsi
to senior officials at Evin prior to the air strike, reportedly warning them to
evacuate and release dissidents held inside. Calls were also made to the offi­cials’
family members.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The source indicated the strike was
intended to avoid harming prisoners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iranian state television confirmed damage
to the prison’s entrance and aired footage of what it said was debris inside
the prison — including a damaged 48-bed hospital — as rescue workers carried
injured and recovered bodies from beneath the rubble. Authorities did not
release any casualty figures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iran’s judiciary confirmed that the prison
was damaged but said that “the situation is under control”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Evin was built before the 1979 Islamic
Revolution but became a site for detain­ing political opponents of the Islamic
regime, including journalists, intellec­tuals, and activists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The number of inmates held there remains
unclear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Leading political prisoner Mostafa Tajzadeh
was able to send a message to his wife yesterday assuring her of his safety.
State television also broadcast footage showing other prisoners making phone
calls to reassure their families.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Since the start of Israel’s war against
Iran on June 13, it has reportedly killed at least 17 senior military
commanders and a dozen nuclear scientists. Iran’s health ministry says 430
people have been killed and 3,500 injured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Israeli officials say 24 of its citizens
have been killed and more than 1,000 injured in Iranian strikes.</span></p>

strikes on nuclear sites</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>States that feted president are left to ponder the risk of
wider war and their own impotence</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=275 height=247 id="Picture 1"

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>LONDON Donald Trump’s decision to join
Israel’s military campaign against Iran has shaken Gulf capitals that only
weeks ago rolled out the red carpet for the US pres­ident and urged him to hold
fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>While Gulf leaders last month feted Trump
with pageantry and trillion-dol­lar investment pledges, behind the scenes the
monarchies pressed him to stick to diplomacy with Tehran and avoid a regional
war they believe would threaten their security and stability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iran has long been a major political and
military rival to the Gulf’s largest economies — Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates — but they have sought to build bridges in recent years and the
eruption of a volatile new con­flict has unnerved the oil and gas states.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Gulf waters that separate Iran from its
Arab neighbours are narrow —</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>just 200 miles across at the widest point
and less than 50 at the tightest. Well within reach of Iran’s short-range mis­siles,
and playing host to key US military bases, Gulf nations desperately want to
avoid being dragged into the conflict.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But Gulf leaders also fear a prolonged
conflict will destabilise Iran, a multi­ethnic state of some 90mn people, or
push its rulers to take drastic action, such as seeking a nuclear weapon. Both
would leave the Gulf to deal with the chaotic aftermath of a war they neither
started nor supported.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“The last time we saw war in the Mid­dle
East, we saw the fragmentation of the region,” said Albadr Alshateri, pro­fessor
at the National Defence College in Abu Dhabi, citing the 2003 US-led inva­sion
of Iraq which he said caused “irrep­arable damage”. The ensuing mayhem
empowered Iran, inflamed sectarian tensions in the region and led to the birth
of Sunni jihadist group Isis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Although Alshateri judged the Ira­nian
regime’s immediate fall to be unlikely, he pointed to the experience of carnage
caused by attempts to collapse regimes in the wider Middle East. He</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>added that for the Gulf, “this is closer”.
Initial reaction to the US strikes was marked by anxiety and apprehension.
Citizens on Sunday morning felt “a mix of shock and concern,” said Eyad Alre-
fai, faculty member of King Abdulaziz University’s political science depart­ment
in Saudi Arabia. “Social media platforms are flooded with urgent dis­cussions,”
he added. “The atmosphere is charged with emotions”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In Kuwait, the closest Gulf state to Iran
physically, people had reacted on a “spectrum”, said a Kuwaiti consultant,
“from those who are in denial that any­thing will ever come our way to those
who are in total hoarding panic”. The state’s finance ministry reassured
employees its complex had shelters equipped to fit 900 people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As British Airways became the latest
western carrier to suspend flights to Dubai and Doha, two expatriate work­ers
in Qatar said they had heard of par­ents keeping children home from school
while some families had departed for summer holidays early. And while nuclear
monitors around the region told the public that there was no change in</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>radiation levels, Bahrain sent 70 per cent
of civil servants home, activated remote learning for schools and urged
motorists to avoid main roads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The campaign against Iran under­scores how
Israel’s military operations are frustrating the Gulf’s desire to focus on its
own economic development. Gulf analysts argue Israel’s ambitions extend well
beyond Iran. “Look at what they’re doing today within their direct environ­ment,”
said Bader Al-Saif, assistant pro­fessor at Kuwait University, listing</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Israel’s military action in Lebanon, Syria
and Iraq. “What if they come out victorious with Iran? They’ll be dictat­ing
the show in the region and we can’t accept this.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For the past week, the region’s leaders
have condemned Israel’s offensive on their longtime rival, stayed in close con­tact
with Tehran and called for a return to talks between Iran and the Trump
administration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Gulf monarchies have forbidden the US from
launching attacks on Iran from bases on their shores. Diplomats and analysts
say they strongly advised Washington against such a move, alarmed that it would
even leave Gulf states as targets of Iranian retaliation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the UAE
have had a stormy relationship with Tehran. After Trump raised pres­sure on
Iran in his first term, officials in Tehran warned they would damage the United
Arab Emirates’ economy and frighten away expatriate workers. Iran was blamed
for attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf and energy infrastructure in Saudi
Arabia in 2019.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But the attacks elicited what the Gulf</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>saw as a lackluster US response, sowing
doubt about the steadfastness of US security commitment that pushed sev­eral
states towards seeking rapproche­ment with Tehran. After several years of
defusing tension, “the relationship between the Arab side and the Iranians is
at its best”, said Alshateri.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hasan Alhasan, Bahrain-based senior fellow
for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies,
said that for all the calls for urgent dialogue, the diplomatic sway of Gulf
states was limited in this crisis. “The best the Gulf states can do is be
prepared, signal their non-involvement to Iran and keep the offer of mediation
on the table,” Alhasan said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The apparent lack of influence on Trump’s
decisions comes despite the Gulf states’ efforts to burnish their rela­tionship
with the US since his return to power. Analysts argue Gulf-US relations remain
strong, and statements on Sun­day by Gulf countries were careful not to
criticise Trump’s intervention explic­itly. The only exception was Oman, the
facilitator of US-Iran nuclear talks, which attacked the strikes as “illegal”.</span></p>
