style='font-style:normal'>Before dawn in the US on Saturday, plane spotters
using flight tracker apps noticed B-2 stealth bombers based in Missouri flying
to the Pacific, sparking speculation they were heading to Guam to prepare for
an attack on Iran.<br>
As experts debated why the B-2s were flying towards Guam and not Diego Garcia,
an Indian Ocean location closer to Iran where the US and UK have a base, the US
was already conducting a top-secret attack on Iran.<br>
Very early on Saturday eastern time, seven other B-2s took off from Whiteman
Air Force Base in Missouri. Unlike the planes that flew to the Pacific and made
themselves detectable at times, the seven B-2s flew east in stealth mode.
Roughly 18 hours later, they dropped 14 massive bunker-buster bombs on two of
Iran’s three nuclear sites that were hit in the strikes.<br>
After the strikes on Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, US defence secretary Pete
Hegseth said Operation Midnight Ham­mer involved very tight operational
security and “misdirection”.<br>
“The scope and scale of what occurred . . . would take the breath away of
almost any American if you had an opportunity to watch it in real time,”
Hegseth said. “Tehran is certainly calcu­lating the reality that planes flew
from the middle of America ... completely undetected over three of their most
highly sensitive sites and we were able to destroy nuclear capabilities.”<br>
Hegseth was flanked by General Dan “Razin” Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs
of staff, who said the B-2 bombers that flew west to the Pacific were a “decoy”
designed to ensure “tactical surprise”. Caine said the “deception effort [was]
known only to an extremely small number of planners and key lead­ers” in
Washington and at US Central Command, which oversees US forces in the Middle
East.Mark Kimmitt, former deputy direc­tor for strategy and plans at Centcom,
said the operational security was impressive. “In my years in the military and
government, I never saw it this tight.” Doug Birkey, head of the Mitchell
Institute for Aerospace Studies, said the bombers used a “conceal-reveal”
tactic with some planes making themselves detectable, while others stayed
stealth.<br>
Caine said the strikes started at 12.30am Sunday in Iran when a US sub­marine
launched 24 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Isfahan as the B-2s entered Iranian
airspace. The B-2s hit their tar­gets between 2.10am and 2.35am. Shortly
afterwards, the Tomahawks reached Isfahan — timed to ensure the B-2s maintained
an element of surprise.<br>
<br>
Caine said the bombers and their accompanying refuelling aircraft and fighter
jets — known as the “strike pack­age” — had flown in and out of Iranian
airspace without corning under any fire.“This was a carefully crafted mission
which utilised significant operational deception, notably, sending a decoy set
of B-2 bombers to Guam,” said James Stavridis, a former US supreme allied
commander in Europe. “The media fix­ated on the Guam movement, and I suspect it
made the Iranians think they had another few days.”<br>
<br>
Joseph Votel, who commanded Cent­com for the first two years of Donald Trump’s
first presidency, said flying B-2s from Missouri enhanced secrecy. “By
deploying directly from the US, the joint force was doing everything it could
to minimise detection, which is very smart,” he said.Kimmitt said sending B-2s
to Guam was a “nice little head fake”, but that the key strategic deception
came earlier. “The ultimate deception was Trump laying down a two-week timeline
for negotiations and then attacking Iran three days later, a classic Trojan
horse,” he said. On Thursday, Trump gave Tehran a “maximum” of two weeks to
reach a nuclear deal with the US, sug­gesting that a strike was not imminent.
Two days later, the US struck the three Iranian nuclear facilities.But there
were signs Trump had made his decision, even if he had not given the order, by
Thursday. Three people famil­iar with the situation said he left leaders at the
G7 in Canada last weekend with the impression he would strike Iran.<br>
<br>
They said he had presented options to other leaders. A fourth person said he
told the group de-escalation had not and would not work. He told the leaders
that any attack would involve one run against Iran. “It was clear to me that he
was already preparing his talking points,” said one of the people.However,
following the G7, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Trump said
“nothing... to suggest he’s about to get involved in this conflict”.<br>
When the UK, France, Germany and the EU held talks with Iran on Friday, UK
foreign secretary David Lammy was unaware of the imminent attack. But he tried
to convince Iran it could not afford to slow-walk negotiations with Wash­ington,
according to one person close to the talks.<br>
Several people said Trump seemed to have been convinced the risks had been
significantly reduced since Israel had degraded Iran’s air defences with its
attacks prior to the US mission.<br>
Underscoring the secrecy, Hegseth said the administration notified Con­gress
after the attack. However, a spokesperson for Republican House Speaker Mike
Johnson said he was briefed before the strikes.<br>
The US gave no notice to most allies. The US did co-ordinate with Israel, according
to the Israeli government.<br>
<br>
The US and Israel also engaged in co­ordinated deception ahead of Israel
launching its attack on Iran on June 13. Leaks to the Israeli media suggested
that Netanyahu and Trump had held a fractious phone call over Iran with Trump
pushing for a diplomatic solution, which one person familiar with the call said
was an attempt to dupe Tehran.</span></span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Israel hits Tehran’s Evin prison as strikes intensify</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Israel launched air strikes on Tehran’s notorious Evin
prison yesterday, caus­ing panic and chaos among inmates in one of the worst
days of bombing on Iran since the war began this month.</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><img border=0 width=417 height=235
src=" image003.jpg"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Israel escalated its attacks on Tehran and
the nearby city of Karaj, claiming it targeted military bases and the entrance
gate of Evin prison, which houses political prisoners, activists and foreigners
accused of espionage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iranian media reported that a sepa­rate
electricity facility was also hit, resulting in several hours of power out­ages
in some neighbourhoods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The strike on Evin — which came as Iran
launched its own round of strikes on Israel — shocked the public.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Many residents viewed it as a sign of
Israel’s lack of restraint, though Iranian opposition overseas claimed that the
prison was hit as a symbol of the regime’s repression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sajedeh Arabsorkhi, a social activist
formerly imprisoned on charges of “propaganda against the Islamic repub­lic”,
spoke out about the targeting of Evin. “The area near the entrance is usually
busy, not just with guards but also with people brought in for initial judicial
processing,” she told the Finan­cial Times. “Prison is like a hospital. Those
inside are helpless. How can Israel justify striking prisoners who can­not even
flee? Claiming this is about tar­geting a symbol of the regime ... is deceitful
and shameful.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>According to a source familiar with the
incident, Israeli intelligence sent dozens of text and phone messages in Farsi
to senior officials at Evin prior to the air strike, reportedly warning them to
evacuate and release dissidents held inside. Calls were also made to the offi­cials’
family members.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The source indicated the strike was
intended to avoid harming prisoners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iranian state television confirmed damage
to the prison’s entrance and aired footage of what it said was debris inside
the prison — including a damaged 48-bed hospital — as rescue workers carried
injured and recovered bodies from beneath the rubble. Authorities did not
release any casualty figures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iran’s judiciary confirmed that the prison
was damaged but said that “the situation is under control”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Evin was built before the 1979 Islamic
Revolution but became a site for detain­ing political opponents of the Islamic
regime, including journalists, intellec­tuals, and activists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The number of inmates held there remains
unclear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Leading political prisoner Mostafa Tajzadeh
was able to send a message to his wife yesterday assuring her of his safety.
State television also broadcast footage showing other prisoners making phone
calls to reassure their families.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Since the start of Israel’s war against
Iran on June 13, it has reportedly killed at least 17 senior military
commanders and a dozen nuclear scientists. Iran’s health ministry says 430
people have been killed and 3,500 injured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Israeli officials say 24 of its citizens
have been killed and more than 1,000 injured in Iranian strikes.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Gulf allies feel sidelined and nervous following US
strikes on nuclear sites</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>States that feted president are left to ponder the risk of
wider war and their own impotence</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=275 height=247
src=" image004.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>LONDON Donald Trump’s decision to join
Israel’s military campaign against Iran has shaken Gulf capitals that only
weeks ago rolled out the red carpet for the US pres­ident and urged him to hold
fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>While Gulf leaders last month feted Trump
with pageantry and trillion-dol­lar investment pledges, behind the scenes the
monarchies pressed him to stick to diplomacy with Tehran and avoid a regional
war they believe would threaten their security and stability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iran has long been a major political and
military rival to the Gulf’s largest economies — Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates — but they have sought to build bridges in recent years and the
eruption of a volatile new con­flict has unnerved the oil and gas states.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Gulf waters that separate Iran from its
Arab neighbours are narrow —</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>just 200 miles across at the widest point
and less than 50 at the tightest. Well within reach of Iran’s short-range mis­siles,
and playing host to key US military bases, Gulf nations desperately want to
avoid being dragged into the conflict.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But Gulf leaders also fear a prolonged
conflict will destabilise Iran, a multi­ethnic state of some 90mn people, or
push its rulers to take drastic action, such as seeking a nuclear weapon. Both
would leave the Gulf to deal with the chaotic aftermath of a war they neither
started nor supported.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“The last time we saw war in the Mid­dle
East, we saw the fragmentation of the region,” said Albadr Alshateri, pro­fessor
at the National Defence College in Abu Dhabi, citing the 2003 US-led inva­sion
of Iraq which he said caused “irrep­arable damage”. The ensuing mayhem
empowered Iran, inflamed sectarian tensions in the region and led to the birth
of Sunni jihadist group Isis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Although Alshateri judged the Ira­nian
regime’s immediate fall to be unlikely, he pointed to the experience of carnage
caused by attempts to collapse regimes in the wider Middle East. He</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>added that for the Gulf, “this is closer”.
Initial reaction to the US strikes was marked by anxiety and apprehension.
Citizens on Sunday morning felt “a mix of shock and concern,” said Eyad
Alrefai, faculty member of King Abdulaziz University’s political science depart­ment
in Saudi Arabia. “Social media platforms are flooded with urgent dis­cussions,”
he added. “The atmosphere is charged with emotions”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In Kuwait, the closest Gulf state to Iran
physically, people had reacted on a “spectrum”, said a Kuwaiti consultant,
“from those who are in denial that any­thing will ever come our way to those
who are in total hoarding panic”. The state’s finance ministry reassured
employees its complex had shelters equipped to fit 900 people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As British Airways became the latest
western carrier to suspend flights to Dubai and Doha, two expatriate work­ers
in Qatar said they had heard of par­ents keeping children home from school
while some families had departed for summer holidays early. And while nuclear
monitors around the region told the public that there was no change in</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>radiation levels, Bahrain sent 70 per cent
of civil servants home, activated remote learning for schools and urged
motorists to avoid main roads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The campaign against Iran under­scores how
Israel’s military operations are frustrating the Gulf’s desire to focus on its
own economic development. Gulf analysts argue Israel’s ambitions extend well
beyond Iran. “Look at what they’re doing today within their direct environ­ment,”
said Bader Al-Saif, assistant pro­fessor at Kuwait University, listing</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Israel’s military action in Lebanon, Syria
and Iraq. “What if they come out victorious with Iran? They’ll be dictat­ing
the show in the region and we can’t accept this.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For the past week, the region’s leaders
have condemned Israel’s offensive on their longtime rival, stayed in close con­tact
with Tehran and called for a return to talks between Iran and the Trump
administration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Gulf monarchies have forbidden the US from
launching attacks on Iran from bases on their shores. Diplomats and analysts
say they strongly advised Washington against such a move, alarmed that it would
even leave Gulf states as targets of Iranian retaliation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the UAE
have had a stormy relationship with Tehran. After Trump raised pres­sure on
Iran in his first term, officials in Tehran warned they would damage the United
Arab Emirates’ economy and frighten away expatriate workers. Iran was blamed
for attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf and energy infrastructure in Saudi
Arabia in 2019.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But the attacks elicited what the Gulf</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>saw as a lackluster US response, sowing
doubt about the steadfastness of US security commitment that pushed sev­eral
states towards seeking rapproche­ment with Tehran. After several years of
defusing tension, “the relationship between the Arab side and the Iranians is
at its best”, said Alshateri.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hasan Alhasan, Bahrain-based senior fellow
for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies,
said that for all the calls for urgent dialogue, the diplomatic sway of Gulf
states was limited in this crisis. “The best the Gulf states can do is be
prepared, signal their non-involvement to Iran and keep the offer of mediation
on the table,” Alhasan said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The apparent lack of influence on Trump’s
decisions comes despite the Gulf states’ efforts to burnish their rela­tionship
with the US since his return to power. Analysts argue Gulf-US relations remain
strong, and statements on Sun­day by Gulf countries were careful not to
criticise Trump’s intervention explic­itly. The only exception was Oman, the
facilitator of US-Iran nuclear talks, which attacked the strikes as “illegal”.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>UK-France migrant deal stokes anger</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Mediterranean states fear having to take back asylum
seekers if pact is sealed</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Italy, Spain and three other southern EU
countries have criticised a proposed Franco-British migration deal, arguing it
could leave them having to take back people returned from the UK to the
continent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The five nations, which also include
Greece, Malta and Cyprus, have sent a letter to the European Commission, seen
by the Financial Times, objecting to France negotiating an arrangement to swap
asylum seekers with Britain in a bid to deter migrants from crossing the
Channel in boats.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We take note — with a degree of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>surprise — of the reported intention of
France to sign a bilateral readmission arrangement,” the letter reads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“If confirmed, such an initiative raises
serious concerns for us, both procedur­ally and in terms of potential implica­tions
for other member states, particu­larly those of first entry,” they wrote in the
letter sent last week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The precise terms of the FrancoBritish deal
remain unclear, but the principle would be to return irregular migrants to
France while Britain accepted asylum seekers seeking resettlement. Such swaps
were first attempted in the EU’s migration deal with Turkey to stem boat
crossings to Greece.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A British official admitted that “the final
hurdles are taking longer than expected” as some EU countries “are more onboard
than others”. French</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>President Emmanuel Macron is due to visit
London on July 8.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As part of the “reset” agreement signed in
May, the EU and the UK pledged to work on “practical and inno­vative
approaches” to reduce irregular migration. But divisions within the EU and
demands from the UK prevented a wider agreement on migration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The UK has instead pushed for bilat­eral
agreements with European capitals on the issue of “small boats”. In the year to
March, 38,000 people crossed the Channel, according to the government.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Mediterranean group objected to France
negotiating the deal with the UK bilaterally, rather than as a part of the
EU-UK “reset” deal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The five signatories — often the first port
of call for people making the jour­ney from Africa — are concerned the ini­tiative
would mean France would, using</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>EU rules, return asylum seekers to the
first country of entry, where their asy­lum claim should be processed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We believe it is essential to clarify
whether the agreement may produce any direct or indirect consequences for other
member states,” they wrote.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The letter comes after UK Prime Min­ister
Sir Keir Starmer sought advice from Italy’s premier, Giorgia Meloni, on curbing
irregular migration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One EU official said that there had been “a
very strong front on the side of the EU that there is no cherry picking” in the
negotiations with the UK, and they were disappointed that the issue had been
exempted from this. “We would have preferred it to be in the context of our
joint negotiations.” <i>Additional reporting by Anna Gross in London, Adrienne

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Germany frets over its big defence budget</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Funding reaches €650bn but notorious red tape hampers overhaul
of neglected military</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=483 height=288

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>After Germany’s new government this week
granted defence minister Boris Pistorius a staggering €650bn for the next five
years to overhaul the country’s long-neglected armed forces, his main challenge
will be spending it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Pistorius must grapple with a pro­curement
bureaucracy that once took seven years to select a new main assault rifle and
more than a decade to procure a helmet for helicopter pilots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He will have to oversee an enormous
expansion by an arms industry already struggling with capacity. And billions
must go towards tasks such as upgrad­ing barracks, some of which are in “dis­astrous”
shape with crumbling plaster and mould, according to the armed forces watchdog.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Pistorius said this week the country could
“finally procure what we need” after Berlin announced Germany’s defence budget
would reach €162bn by 2029 when support for Ukraine is included — up 70 per cent
on this year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But he warned: “All of this presup­poses
that industrial production capac­ity can now be ramped up quickly, scaled up
and adapted to our needs and our orders.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Germany is on track to meet Nato’s new
target of spending 3.5 per cent of GDP on core defence by 2029 — six years
ahead of the western military alliance’s newly agreed deadline. Spurred by Pres­ident
Donald Trump’s threat to pull US security guarantees from the continent,
European nations have agreed to invest more in their own armies. They are also
seeking to deter aggression from Rus­sia’s President Vladimir Putin as his
invasion of Ukraine grinds on into its fourth year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>German military planners must spend tens of
billions on air defence sys­tems, long-range weapons, armoured vehicles and
cyber warfare to meet their new Nato commitments. They also want to develop
satellite systems to boost Europe’s intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance capabilities. “Europeans are racing to fill the gap but it’s a
big ask,” said Ben Schreer, of the Interna­tional Institute for Strategic
Studies. “It will take time and cost a lot of money.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Berlin seeks to grow its professional armed
forces from around 180,000 troops to 260,000 by the mid-2030s. Many experts
believe Germany, which plans to introduce voluntary military service, will
ultimately have to adopt a compulsory model. The Munich-based Ifo Institute
estimates that would cost the government €3.2bn a year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Germany has already made progress in
overhauling the Bundeswehr since Putin’s Ukraine invasion in 2022, when then
chancellor Olaf Scholz unveiled a €100bn special fund for equipping the
military. The head of the army warned then his troops were “more or less
empty-handed”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spending on a whole new scale comes after
new chancellor Friedrich Merz’s decision to allow unlimited borrowing to
re-establish Germany as Europe’s strongest conventional army. But spending
large sums will create huge</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>challenges for Germany’s defence pro­curement
system. The vast Bundeswehr procurement office in Koblenz, with 11,800
employees, was notorious in the past for fastidiously following national and EU
regulations and drawing up complicated custom requirements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The finance ministry in Berlin was another
barrier, with officials with no military expertise debating how many submarines
the navy really needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Pistorius has already had some suc­cess in
changing the culture, calling for speed instead of what he has called
“gold-plated solutions”. Germany has used the €100bn to order a string of
bigticket items including F-35 fighter jets, Chinook helicopters and an Arrow 3
air defence system from Israel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yet frustrations remain. “Sometimes just
drawing up a contract can take an entire year,” said one senior official.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Even once products are ordered, sup­pliers
can be slow to deliver amid huge industry bottlenecks. “When you order a
Patriot [air defence] system today they say: thank you for your order, you will
receive it in 2028,” said the senior official in reference to the US system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Defence companies are excited at the
prospects. But they are also nervous about the challenge of dramatically
expanding production. “When you look at the numbers that are currently circu­lating
in Berlin, it’s almost something to be afraid of,” said an executive at a mid­sized
German weapons maker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Lessons from the Ukraine war, and how the
spoils of the defence budget should be shared, are open to debate. Armin
Papperger, chief executive of artillery and ammunition producer Rheinmetall,
believes “conventional war is back”. But Gundbert Scherf Helsing, co-founder of
AI developer and drone maker Helsing, said: “We’re still counting tanks, ships
and planes. That’s the wrong mindset.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Claudia Major, senior vice-president at the
German Marshall Fund, said it was a false dichotomy. “In the end, we need to
get the right mix, the mix adapted to Nato’s way of fighting — and we need to
get it quickly.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Gentry Beach, the chair of investment firm
America First Global and former finance co-chair of Trump’s campaign in 2016,
is part of a consortium negotiat­ing for rights to the Rubaya coltan mine, said
Congolese officials and people familiar with the matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The mine, outside the city of Goma in
eastern DR Congo, has been at the cen­tre of the trade in smuggled coltan used
in the financing of one of Africa’s longest-running and deadliest wars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Rubaya, which produces about half of DR
Congo’s coltan, was captured in January by Rwandan-backed M23 rebels who have
since overseen and taxed its output. The mine is considered by geologists to be
one of the most commercially promising sources for the tantalum and niobium
used in the electronics industry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>People involved in the discussions hope, if
a deal is finalised, the mine will be part of a raft of US investment under­pinning
the Trump administration’s approach to ending the fighting between DR Congo,
Rwanda and proxy militias.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Foreign ministers of the warring par­ties
yesterday signed a US-brokered peace agreement in Washington. The US is
dangling the prospect of billions of dollars in US investment in mining and
infrastructure as key to persuading them to stop fighting, in an example of
Trump’s signature transactional style of diplomacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Rubaya was one of a number of assets
embattled DR Congo president </span><span lang=FR>Félix </span><span
lang=EN-US>Tshisekedi touted when he first approached Washington in February
offering mining rights in return for help in ending a rebellion in the
country’s east, according to Congolese officials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Both Washington and Kinshasa have expressed
hope that any deals will also dilute Chinese dominance in what is Africa’s
richest store of minerals. DR Congo accounts for about 70 per cent of the
world’s cobalt, as well as some of the continent’s largest reserves of gold,
copper, coltan, tin and diamonds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“When the US stepped in, theywanted to
frame their approach to a peace settlement differently than in the past,” said
one regional participant in the plans, on condition of anonymity. “They were
looking at what the business and economic side of the deal would be that allows
this region to prosper, so we don’t get back into this all over.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Beach, a former hedge fund manager and
long-standing college friend of Trump’s son, Donald Jr, has experience in DR
Congo dating back to a previous 2004 mining venture. Beach was also involved in
ventures in the DR Congo with late Congo-born basketballlegend Dikembe Mutombo.
Although Donald Jr and Beach are old college friends, the president’s son has
no involvement in Beach’s business ven­tures, according to a person close to
Donald Jr.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>America First Global, which declined to
comment, is part of a consortium including Swiss commodities group Mercuria
that hopes to develop the mine in a joint venture with Congolese state miner
Sakima. Mercuria, which also did not comment, would buy offtake from the mine,
which according to people involved could require in excess of $500mn in
investment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Rubaya is an important part of the peace
process ... We hope to dramati­cally expand it, reorganise it, and make it a
world-class example of how to do mining,” one participant of the consor­tium
said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Prospects for peace remain precari­ous and
it is still unclear how, were Rwanda to end its part in the conflict, the M23
rebels they have backed will be persuaded to relinquish Rubaya.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eric Trump has said that “the political
path” for a family dynasty “would be an easy one”, opening the door for another
Trump to seek office after his father leaves the White House.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>His comments came in a wide ranging
Financial Times interview, in which the co-executive vice-president of the
Trump Organization discussed his international real estate dealings, hit back
at criticism that the family is seek­ing to profit from the presidency and
echoed his father’s claims about political persecution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“The real question is: do you want to drag
other members of your family into it?” Eric Trump said. “Would I want my kids
to live the same experience over the last decade that I’ve lived? You know, if
the answer was yes, I think the political path would be an easy one, meaning, I
think I could do it.” He added: “And by the way, I think other members of our
family could do it too.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The 41-year-old, who grew up on the Trump
Tower’s top floor, has been considered less political than his older siblings,
instead focusing on the family business since Donald Trump’s first term began
in 2017.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>His older brother Donald Jr is a fre­quent
fundraiser and Maga podcaster, and his sister Ivanka took a role in the first
Trump White House, while his wife Lara was co-chair of the Republican National
Committee last year. But Eric Trump described himself as “wholly unimpressed by
half the politicians I see ... I could do it very effectively”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Vice-president JD Vance and secre­tary of
state Marco Rubio are seen as favourites for the 2028 Republican nomination.
But as to whether a family member would run, Eric Trump said: “Who knows?”
Asked whether2024will be the last election with a Trump on the ballot, he said:
“I don’t know . .. Time will tell. But there’s more people than just me.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He added: “The question is, do you want to
do it? And do you want to sub­ject the people that you love to the brutality of
this system? And I’m not sure if I can answer that question yet.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>While critics say the second Trump term has
been marked by the presi­dent’s personal involvement in money­ raising
endeavours, the family has often depicted itself as persecuted by a hostile
establishment. “If there’s one family that hasn’t profited off politics, it’s
the Trump family,” Eric Trump said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“In fact, I would sit there and say that we
[would have] had many more zeros behind our name had my father not run in the
first place. The opportunity cost, the legal cost, the toll it’s taken on our
family has been astronomical.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He said the Trump family had spent close to
$500mn “just defending our­selves from Russia shams, fake hoaxes, dirty
dossiers about the unthinkable”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In 2024, a New York judge ordered Donald
Trump and the Trump Organization to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in
penalties after censuring them for “blatantly false financial data”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Donald Jr and Eric Trump were ordered to
pay more than $4mn each and individually barred from doing business in New York
state for two years. The case is being appealed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The family waded into the social media
industry after Donald Trump was barred from Facebook and Twitter fol­lowing the
January 6 2021 attack on the US Capitol, which led him to create his Truth
Social network.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The president’s stake in its parent company
Trump Media &amp; Technology Group is now worth about $2bn on paper, while the
family’s crypto hold­ings may rival its real estate portfolio.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>According to Eric Trump, the family
embraced crypto after being shunned by traditional finance. He now describes it
as a “very profitable venture”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>TMTG has raised $2.5bn to buy bit­coin.
Trump’s World Liberty Financial has also said that an Emirati stateowned
investment firm had used its stablecoin to invest $2bn in Binance. The
president issued his $TRUMP meme­coins days before his return to office and
rewarded top holders with a dinner at his golf course in Virginia last month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eric Trump himself launched crypto mining
company American Bitcoin. He called bitcoin the “gold asset in the mod­ern
era”, saying the cryptocurrency is “better than gold” — “tradeable 24/7”,
“transportable”, “digital”, “immediate” and in limited supply. By contrast, he
told a crypto conference in Las Vegas last month that he “would love to see
some of the big banks go extinct”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>His father, who dismissed crypto in 2019 as
“highly volatile”, “based on thin air” and a facilitator of illegal activity,
is now leading a charge in Washington to boost the industry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>At the same time Eric Trump, who says the
Trump Organization is worth $8bn-$12bn, is striking real estate deals across
the world, despite a pledge the group made ahead of his father’s first term to
avoid new foreign ventures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We got absolutely no credit for doing it,
and we’ve done everything right,” he added, referring to the pledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I’m really busy and my father’s try­ing to
stop world war three,” he said. “My father has nothing to do with com­panies;
he’s not running any of our enti­ties. I run great hotels around the world.
It’s what I’ve done my entire life; I started on our construction jobs when I
was 11 years old. It’s all I’ve ever known.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eric Trump said he was working on “several”
hotels in India. A group con­nected to Mukesh Ambani, India’s rich­est man,
paid a $10mn “development fee” to the Trump Organization. “Pick the five
biggest cities [in India], and we’re going to be there,” he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But, noting the role of geopolitics in
potential deals, he said if there were “true political stability” he would
enter the Israeli market and has had “a hun­dred” opportunities to enter China.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Our brand is hugely popular in China,” he

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Reza Kianian, a veteran award-winning
Iranian actor, has long been a vocal domestic critic of the Islamic republic,
using his popular Instagram page to question tenets of the regime’s ideology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yet when Israel launched its deadly assault
on Iran this month, Kianian swiftly joined the ranks of regime critics rallying
around the flag, part of the surge of patriotic fervour that has swept the
country of 90mn since the 12-day war started. “Iran has existed, exists still,
and will endure,” Kianian said on Instagram after the war began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This newfound sense of unity in the
otherwise polarised country surprised observers and pohticians both at home and
abroad. While Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu sought to tap disillusion­ment by
calling on people to rise up against the Islamic republic, even hard­ened
regime opponents temporarily set aside their criticisms and recoiled against
what they saw as a war against not just their rulers but Iran itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“One person sitting outside Iran can­not
tell a nation to rise up,” Kianian, 74, told the Financial Times. “Iran is my
country. I will decide what to do, and won’t wait for you to tell me what to do
in my own country.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This reawakening of Iranian national­ism
—which politicians hope will persist even if anger towards the Islamic repubHc
returns to the surface — comes after decades of deep polarisation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Iran’s theocratic rulers have long
attempted to suppress an increasingly secular nation’s yearning for economic,
political and social change, responding to unrest with brutal crackdowns.
Amnesty International said more than 300 were killed during protests in 2022
triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, for not
properly wearing a hijab, leaving deep scars on the nation’s psyche.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Though the Islamic republic has since
relaxed its hijab rules, many Iranians are deeply unhappy with the state of the
economy, struggling to cope with infla­tion and US sanctions, and angry at
alleged corruption among those with regime links. Yet when Israel launched its
offensive on June 13, Iranians decided this was not the moment of change they
had hoped for. Many were shaken by the bombardment, which Israel said was aimed
at regime targets but which Iranian officials said killed 627 people and
destroyed 120 residen­tial buildings in Tehran before ending in a fragile
ceasefire on Tuesday. Israeli officials said Iran’s missiles killed 28 people
in Israel and hit residential areas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We felt stuck between forces who only
sought their own ambitions, rather than our wellbeing,” said Maryam, a
39year-old housewife and regime critic, still furious over the deaths in the
2022 protests. Netanyahu reminded us that we could even lose the little we
have. In this sense, he inadvertently served the Islamic repubhc, making us
less hopeful of being able to get rid of this regime.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>To avoid provoking a popular back­lash, the
regime played down its polaris­ing ideology, in which the US and Israel are
eternal enemies and Shia Islam the solution to all problems. Banners put up in
Tehran sought to promote national­ism rather than regime talking points, and
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday praised what he called
the country’s “extraordi­nary unity”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“A nation of 90mn was united and resisted
with one voice, standing shoul­der to shoulder without raising their dif­ferences,”
he said in a video message, which focused on Iran as a nation rather than the
ruling theocracy, clearly aim­ing to keep Iranians united. “It became clear
that in critical times, one voice is heard from the nation.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Officials sought to prolong this patri­otism
by hailing the conflict as a “vic­tory”, despite the devastating blows to the
regime, military and Iran’s nuclear programme. “Let’s not forget there were no
anti-war protests in the streets and the government made sure there was
sufficient supply of food and fuel every­where,” one regime insider said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The war appears, for the time being at
least, to have boosted some domestic support for Iran’s ballistic missile pro­gramme,
the government’s crackdown on alleged Israeli collaborators and even enthusiasm
for acquiring a nuclear bomb, something the Islamic republic says it is not
pursuing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yet maintaining this unity will not be
easy, with critics of the regime calling for a reckoning over the Islamic republic’s
role in setting Iran on a path to war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kianian said hardliners within the regime,
including on state television, should be held accountable for the extent to
which their policies contrib­uted to the conflict.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hardliners have repeatedly said Israel
should be wiped off the map and that support for militant proxies like Hizbol­lah
in Lebanon should continue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“They keep saying on television that we are
all together, from left to right,” he said. “It took them too long to realise
that we are united, and only when there was no other choice during wartime did
they say it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>To many Iranians, the Islamic republic
should not take this national solidar­ity for granted and double down on divi­sive
policies, with issues that have enraged Iranians continuing to fester.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“What has saved Iran is not a delu­sional
ideology but its ancient his­tory ... and the experience of surviving invasions
by Alexander, the Mongols and the Arabs,” Fayyaz Zahed, a reform­ist political

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Perhaps only history teachers in the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Supreme Court has handed Donald Trump a
victory in his effort to force­fully remake US policy, in a decision that
blocked lower courts from halting his order to end birthright citizenship
nationwide.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The court’s 6-3 ruling, which split along
ideological lines, was issued in a case addressing Trump’s executive order from
his first day in office seeking to curtail citizenship for children of ille­gal
immigrants. It strengthens Trump’s hand on a wide array of issues from trade to
immigration. The court’s ruling did not address the merits of so-called
birthright citizenship itself, which auto­matically grants US nationality to
all children born in the country, including those of unauthorised immigrants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But it granted the administration’s request
to limit injunctions by lower courts, which have blocked his policy measures on
issues ranging from union representation to gender transition care.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“GIANT WIN in the United States Supreme
Court!” the president posted on his Truth Social network yesterday. “Even the
Birthright Citizenship Hoax has been, indirectly, hit hard.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The principal impact of the ruling is to
limit lower courts’ ability to make rulings with an impact well beyond the par­ties
in a case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“When a court concludes that the Executive
Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its
power, too,” the majority opinion said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Trump’s executive order will not go into
effect for 30 days, allowing lower courts to “determine whether a nar­rower
injunction is appropriate”, according to the opinion authored by conservative
justice Amy Coney Barrett</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The court’s three liberal justices dis­sented
from the majority opinion, rea­soning that it would clear the way for unlawful
policies to take effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The government “asks this Court to hold
that, no matter how illegal a law or policy, courts can never simply tell the
Executive to stop enforcing it against anyone”, said liberal justice Sonia
Sotomayor, highlighting that every court that had assessed Trump’s birth­right
order found it “patently unconsti­tutional”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She also warned against the precedent set
by the opinion. “No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates,”
she said. “Today, the threat is to birth­right citizenship. Tomorrow, a
different administration may try to seize fire­arms from law-abiding citizens
or pre­vent people of certain faiths from gath­ering to worship”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Trump and other top officials have harshly

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Trump has argued that the Four­teenth
Amendment, which grants birth­right citizenship, did not “extend citi­zenship

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>South Korean band BTS are set to reunite
after members completed their military service, fuelling talk about a new album
that analysts hope will reinvigorate K-pop, one of the country’s biggest
cultural exports.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Five members of the band — RM, V, Jimin,
Jung Kook and Suga — were discharged from military service this month, joining
j-hope and Jin, whose service ended last year. “Thank you for your patience,”
Suga wrote in a social media post, vowing to “try our best to repay the love
you have given us”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I will quickly make an album and return to
the stage,” RM, the group’s leader, said on his discharge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The boy group’s reunion comes at a critical
time for the K-pop industry. Korean music sales worldwide rose 7 per cent last
year but the rate of growth was less than half that of2023. Physical sales of
South Korean pop albums — still vital sources of revenue and profit for the
country’s music labels — fell 17 per cent last year, according to Circle Chart,
a South Korean music information website. Monthly active user numbers of
leading K-pop online fan platforms also fell in 2024.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“The return of the most influential K-pop
idols will help create another wave of Korea’s soft power and will have a
positive impact on exports of the country’s other consumer-facing industries,”
said Jeong Kwang-woo, an independent analyst and former fund manager.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>South Korea’s cultural exports, including
music, films and broadcasting, have surged in recent years, reaching an
estimated $13.6bn in 2024, according to the state-run Korea Creative Content
Agency. The music industry, which accounted for 13.6 per cent of total cultural
export value, soared 51.5 per cent to $1.85bn last year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Since BTS’s debut single in June 2013, they
have released a series of hit songs including “Dynamite” and “Butter”, becoming
the first K-pop act to top the Billboard album charts in 2018 and to receive a
Grammy Award nomination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But the group have been on hiatus for the
past two years as the band members completed their 18-month mandatory military
service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Shares of Hybe, the band’s label,have
surged 57 per cent this year on expectations of a comeback. Hybe has said BTS
will return as a group but the tuning is “still under discussion”. Each of the
group’s members has pursued solo projects during their break.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Even during their military service, the
BTS fandom kept growing,” said Im Soo-jin, an analyst at Daishin Securities.
“New boy bands like the Stray Kids, Seventeen, Enhypen, partly filled the
vacuum, but they have failed to replace BTS.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jin is starting his first world tour with a
domestic concert today while j-hope has wrapped up a solo tour, raising hope
among fans that the reunited band might go on tour and release an album early
next year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Despite a dip in album sales, Jeong said
interest in K-pop remained strong, referring to the Netflix animated fantasy
drama <i>Kpop Demon Hunters.</i> “K-pop remains hot. But the quality of their
next album will be the key for BTS to continue their success.” <i>Song Jung-a

<h3><span lang=EN-US>A dramatic few days in US foreign policy, from strikes on
Iran to a Nato summit, underscore how global leaders are gripped by the
seemingly impulsive whims and stratagems of the president. </span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=602 height=330

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>America’s transatlantic allies had reason
to be worried ahead of the Nato summit at The Hague this week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>After a manic few days for US foreign
policy that included American air strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, the US
president seemed in no mood for pleasantries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As he left the White House for the trip to
the Netherlands, his frustration at the state of negotiations with Israel and
Iran boiled over into profanity. “We basically have two countries that have
been fight­ing so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re
doing,” Trump told reporters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yet the president defied worries at the
summit, allowing the pact that has underpinned European security since the dawn
of the cold war to live on. “When I was around that table, it was a nice group
of people,” Trump said during his closing press conference in The Hague on
Wednesday. “It’s not a rip-off. And we are here to help them protect their
[countries] ”, he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Trump was satisfied because he has finally
secured pledges by nearly all Nato members to sharply increase their defence
spending, the issue over which he has berated and threatened them since early
in his first term. His mood was also lifted by the heavy dose of flat­tery he
received from Mark Rutte, the former Dutch prime minister and new head of Nato.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But the bonhomie at Nato was so hard won
that it exposed just how gripped the world is by the whims of the man in the
White House, and Trump’s boisterous and volatile foreign policy tactics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Just this month, the US president left a G7
summit in Canada early in dramatic fashion to return to Washington to con­sider
strikes against Iran’s nuclear facili­ties, proceeded with the military action
within five days and then promptly bro­kered a ceasefire deal in a bid to end
the hostilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He arrived at the Nato summit argu­ing that
the mutual defence pact at the heart of the alliance was “open to inter­pretation”,
causing a level of panic among some delegations. But Tramp said little more in
the Netherlands to undermine the alliance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Both internationally and domesti­cally,
officials and investors are left struggling to understand if he is an
interventionist or a peacemaker, or if there is any guiding theory to his
actions and rhetoric.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The president seems to exhibit no
“particular ideological agenda”, says Julian Zelizer, a political history
profes­sor at Princeton University. “When he sees an opportunity for himself
and for his power, he takes it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Foreign capitals are also trying to cal­culate
whether resistance to Trump may be the best option to safeguard their economies
and interests despite the obvious risks, or if acquiescence might be the safer
bet. But at some point they all know they will have to grapple with Trump’s
gyrations and often irasci­ble demands, sometimes transmitted via social media.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“The core of Tramp’s foreign policy is
unpredictability,” says Ray Takeyh, a former state department senior adviser on
Iran, now at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It almost doesn’t matter if he
is staffed by internationalists, restrain­ers or isolationists. He will do what
he wants and others have to adjust.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Trump’s decision to order air strikes on
Iran’s nuclear facilities last weekend was still very much at the top of mind
when he arrived in the Netherlands on Tuesday for the Nato summit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The US president and his top national security
advisers had managed to cob­ble together a tenuous truce between Israel and
Iran on the eve of his trip, eas­ing some of the fears of regional escala­tion
in the Middle East.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We think it’s over. I don’t think they’re
going to be going back at each other,” Trump said in the Netherlands. “We’ve
also reasserted the credibility of American deterrence, which is like no
other,” he added.But while the diplomatic and military shockwaves from the US
air strikes were still rever­berating around the world, and the president even invoked
the possibility of “regime change” in Tehran, he was quickly placed on the
defensive by revelations that the initial assessment by military intelligence
found that the air strikes set back Iran’s nuclear programme by only a few
months</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tramp was quick to dismiss the con­clusions,
which were discordant with his claim that the nuclear facilities had been
“obliterated,” then proceeded to attack the media outlets including CNN and the
New York Times who first reported on the findings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“For Trump, The Hague summit was about two
things: a ‘Victory in Europe’ Day over defence spending and a fight with the US
media over the status of the Iranian nuclear programme,” says Joel Linnainmaki,
research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, a
think-tank. “He was mostly focused on the latter. The core concern of Tramp’s
foreign policy is how things appear to his base back home.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But the furore obscured another unfolding
shift in Trump’s Iran policy: in the wake of the ceasefire, the US said it was
willing to relaunch negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear pro­gramme as
early as next week — which could potentially lead to a loosening of sanctions
on the country.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Even the hawkish Lindsey Graham, the South
Carolina </span><span lang=ES-TRAD>Republica </span><span lang=EN-US>senator
who is a close ally of Trump, seemed unsettled by the possibility. “I don’t
want people to think the problem is over, because it’s not,” he told reporters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yet despite the whiplash, many Republicans
think Trump’s Iran strat­egy has been successful so far.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We very well may have created the
conditions for Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions, and time will tell,” says
Heather Nauert, a former state depart­ment official in Trump’s first term. “But
we have got them to a place where they’re willing to sit down and have what I
hope will be a serious conversa­tion about the future of their country.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But to critics of the White House, it has
all seemed haphazard. “The admin­istration seems to be making it up as they go
along, with senior officials never knowing from one minute to the next whether
what they say or do will be undermined by a presidential tweet,” says Jim
Townsend, former US deputy assistant secretary of defence for Euro­pean and
Nato policy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A successful Nato summit had by no means
been a foregone conclusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Beyond Trump’s ques­tioning of Article 5,
the mutual defence treaty, allies were braced for the potential Trump fallout from
Spain’s last-minute opt out from the soon-to-be-agreed target of 5 per cent of
GDP for defence spending, which threatened to torpedo it all. “Spain’s not
agreeing, which is very unfair to the rest of them,” Trump said on Air Force
One.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As Trump dined with the king and queen of
the Netherlands and other world leaders on Tuesday night, the offi­cials,
diplomats and security experts at events on the sidelines of the summit were
preparing themselves for just how badly the following day would go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Europeans “need to do everything we can to
keep the US” onboard, even if that means having to “dance like mon­keys” for
Trump, said one foreign policy adviser to a Nato member government.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Praise from Rutte, who even called Trump
“daddy” during a bilateral meet­ing, helped win him over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Donald, you have driven us to a really,
really important moment for America and Europe, and the world,” Rutte wrote in
a text message to the president, who then posted it on TruthSocial. “You will
achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the end, The Hague summit decla­ration
enshrined the commitment by Nato members to spend 5 per cent on defence by
2035, citing “the long­term threat posed by Russia to Euro­Atlantic security
and the persistent threat of terrorism.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>General David Petraeus, who led sev­eral US
military campaigns in the Mid­dle East, told CNN this week that Trump’s “angry
man theory” of diplo­macy appeared to be working.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I think he has done this very effec­tively.
He has expressed his displeasure repeatedly. They have clearly taken it very
seriously. There’s been a lot of soul searching in Europe . . . They’re very
concerned about [Trump’s] response, and they have taken action as a result, and
that is great to see,” he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spain, however, remained the hold­out in
refusing to meet the defence spending target. The US president had no mercy for
Prime Minister Pedro </span><span lang=ES-TRAD>Sánchez </span><span lang=EN-US>during
his press conference, insisting that he could punish Madrid on trade for not
complying as the US and EU try to hash out a deal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We’re negotiating with Spain on a trade
deal. We’re going to make them pay twice as much, and I’m actually seri­ous
about that,” Trump said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Trade is likely to displace national
security in Trump’s attention in coming weeks, with the approach of the July 9
deadline set by Washington for many of America’s trading partners to reach a
deal or face higher levies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>After the huge equity market drop and even
Treasury sell-off in the after­math of the president’s steep “liberation day”
levies on a string of countries, Trump is under pressure to either extend the
deadline or reach deals to avert the higher tariffs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In defence, too, the success of Tramp’s
huge geopolitical ventures will be meas­ured by their long-term dur ability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“The Iran strike seems to have succeeded,
and the Nato allies are com­mitted to paying more,” says Takeyh. “The key
question is whether these triumphs are shortlived. If Iran now develops a bomb
surreptitiously and the alliance fractures over issues of burden-sharing then
it is a more prob­lematic thing.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Alter two decades of violent civil con­flict
and war, Nicaraguans were stunned when, in 1990, a woman in a white suit
declared a new republic born of the peo­ple’s vote, not bullets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Violeta Chamorro, who has died aged 95, was
the first female president elected in the Americas. A conciliatory figure, she
guided Nicaragua from war to peace between 1990 and 1997.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Thrust into politics by the murder of her
husband Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, she evolved from a homemaker to serv­ing
alongside former guerrilla fighter Daniel Ortega. She soon grew disillu­sioned
over the left-wing junta’s direc­tion and defeated Ortega at the ballot box at
the head of a broad anti-govern­ment coalition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Her victory marked the Central American
country’s first undisputed, peaceful democratic transition and broke new ground
for female leaders in the region. “Her courage to step into that role, despite
the personal tragedy and political chaos she faced, paved the way for women’s
leadership in Latin America,” said Nicaraguan activist Bianca Jagger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Born into a wealthy farming family in 1929,
where she was one of seven chil­dren, Cnamorro went to Roman Catnolic schools
in Nicaragua and then the US. Married in 1950, she largely remained behind the
scenes, raising her children. But the 1978 murder of her husband, a newspaper
editor and government critic, triggered riots that helped over­throw a brutal
US-backed dictatorship and led her into politics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She took over his newspaper, La Prensa,
before joining the five-member revolutionary junta that ruled the coun­try
after the fall of dictator Anastasio Somoza. She quickly became critical of its
Marxist ideology, though, and even­tually built backing to run as opposition
unity candidate to Ortega.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>On the night of the 1990 election, Ortega
had been widely expected to win, with tensions high over whether, if she were
victorious, Chamorro would unleash a wave of revenge against the Sandinistas,
who had ruled since 1979.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Was it going to be a terrible dark night
or different?” Jagger said. “That’s why Mrs Chamorro was such an extraordinary
figure in Nicaragua, because instead of allowing revenge against Sandinistas,
she became a sym­bol of reconciliation.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But she inherited tremendous challenges.
Nicaragua was polarised by war and in the throes of economic decline and
hyperinflation. Across Latin Amer­ica, countries were trying to recover from a
“lost decade” of stagnation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Chamorro’s IMF-backed plan of spending
cuts, privatisations and trade opening steadied the ship, but many Nicaraguans
remember it as a difficult period. US and broader international interest had
waned quickly after she won and she didn’t contest the 1996 presidential
election, retiring from politics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“There was a lot of criticism of her on
both the left and the right,” said Eline van Ommen, a historian at the Univer­sity
of Leeds. “She was quite a nuanced figure; she doesn’t really fit that blackand-white
story of heroes and villains that people tried to create about the revolution.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually though, most Nicaraguans came to
credit her record for disarming both the US-backed Contras and USSR funded
Sandinistas. She combined pragmatic, pro-democracy views with a social
conservatism informed by her Catholic faith, and a down-to-earth manner of
speaking. “She didn’t pre­tend to be a know-it-all, a great intellectual,”
Nicaraguan writer </span><span lang=ES-TRAD>Gioconda </span><span lang=EN-US>Belli
wrote this month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Many supporters came to see her as an
almost maternal figure. Belli — a former Sandinista — said she didn’t cele­brate
her victory in 1990 but later saw she had “instinctive wisdom”. Chamorro said
that once, when trying to persuade a group of Salvadoran fighters to disarm,
she noticed a loose button on one of the men’s tops and offered to sew it on
for him, she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Thank God — she told me — from there on
everything went smoothly — and she added — We’re all human my dear, who doesn’t
need someone to sew on a button for them?” Belli wrote in </span><span
lang=ES-TRAD>Confidencial, </span><span lang=EN-US>the newspaper founded by
Chamorro’s son Carlos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Chamorro clung on in an increasingly
dictatorial Nicaragua until 2023. She died in Costa Rica, where many of her
compatriots now live after fleeing eco­nomic instability and political repres­sion
under Ortega, who has been in power for 23 of the past 40 years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I promise you that when Nicaragua is once
again a republic, you will return to rest in peace in your home,” her daugh­ter

<h2><span lang=EN-US>The Iran threat will haunt the Gulf for years</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>What Tehran’s neighbours once saw as a problem manageable
through a deal is now an intractable one</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It is hard to miss the optimism and
euphoria in Tel Aviv, Washington and not a few western capitals. The crushing
of Iran’s power will deliver stability and peace in the Middle East, many like
to believe. US envoy Steve Witkoff has announced that several, still unnamed,
countries will normalise relations with Israel shortly, though these may not be
Arab states. Some Israeli strategists have already proposed an “Abraham Shield
Plan”, which would enshrine Israeli dominance and secure political and economic
benefits without presenting any concessions related to Palestinian statehood.
Above all, Israel shows no desire for a negotiated end to the Gaza war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Contrast that with the stupor and sense of
dread pervading the Gulf</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>region, which just experienced its fifth
major conflagration in five decades. After the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, the
1990-91 Gulf war, the 2003 US invasion and occupation of Iraq and its bloody
aftermath and years of damaging intra Gulf disputes, there was hope that an
agenda of global integration and regional prosperity would shield the region
from turmoil. Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE in May
was carefully designed to get US buy-in for this vision.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Instead, and despite all their efforts,
Israel attacked Iran two weeks ago, followed by a US strike against Iranian
nuclear facilities. Iran’s retaliation against a US base in Qatar, however
calibrated and choreographed, produced images of Qatari nationals and foreign
workers running for safety. US-backed Qatari air defences performed well and
there were no casualties. But the shock to a country that hosted the football
World Cup a few years ago and for neighbours who pride themselves on stability,
safety and ease of business is unmistakable. The Gulf states must now plan for
a prolonged period of uncertainty and instability. From their perspective, the
war has been inconclusive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Regardless of the extent of the damage done
to Iran’s nuclear facilities, the next years will be shaped by whether Tehran
leaves the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, whether Israel and the US continue
bombing and whether Iran builds a rudimentary nuclear device. What Gulf states
once saw as a threat manageable through a deal — an Iran perennially below the
nuclear threshold and with curtailed regional reach — is now an intractable one
that will affect their own stability for decades. This will keep the Gulf
states and those who want to invest or live there nervous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>All analogies are imperfect and
selfserving, but consider the following one: today looks eerily like Iraq in
1991. A militarised regime has survived, albeit in a weakened form. It can no
longer project force and may have to tame its rebellious periphery, but it can
still disrupt its neighbourhood. Domestic and exiled opposition forces are
weak. And its leaders still believe that regime change is the undeclared goal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Contrary to the 1990s, when a globally
dominant US took ownership of the management of Iraq and had a legal basis for
doing so, today’s America is uninterested in any such commitment. Having
demonstrated US power more</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>emphatically than any military parade
could, Trump has neither the interest nor the focus to pursue a complex and
sustainable settlement that simultaneously constrains and integrates Iran
regionally. Even if he did, Israel would probably resist such a design for it
would curtail its own freedom of action. Israel is primarily interested in
operating unimpeded wherever it fights. What matters is that its aircraft can
fly at will and its spies can operate anywhere, and for foes as well as
partners to accept this unconditionally. A weakened Iran will be too busy
licking its wounds and settling internal scores to risk high-stakes diplomacy
except to buy time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Its nuclear brinkmanship may have backfired
badly, but it remains a card Tehran can play. It will also have to rethink its
defence posture. Deterring and attacking Israel through medium range ballistic
missiles and militias has failed. Investing in homeland defence remains
expensive and even more difficult: Russia has proven to be far less than an
all-weather friend and will not prioritise Iran’s needs. China is now hyped as
Iran’s next best bet, but Beijing will have learnt from this conflict that less
exposure to Middle East politics serves it better. The remaining tools in
Iran’s arsenal are the more accurate and plentiful short-range systems
(missiles but also drones) that are useful only within the Gulf region.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>All this means that the Gulf states must
now spend more time and attention on managing Iran. They are likely to seek
better air defences to match Israel’s impressive shield and more missiles to
have credible means of deterrence. This ensures lasting defence relations with
western states. But despite having both been attacked by Tehran in recent
years, Doha and Riyadh are more inclined to show patience and magnanimity these
days. There will be political statements, visits and economic inducements — as
well as greater criticism of the US and Israel. Ironically, Israel’s success
against Iran further reduces Saudi Arabia’s already-waning desire to normalise
with Israel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>While discussions in western capitals
depict Iran as a spent force, the country will remain a threat to its
neighbours and at the centre of conversations across the Middle East for years
to come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the small hours of Wednesday morning, a
33-year-old man of South Asian descent walked out into a crowded bar in Long
Island City to announce that he had achieved the unimaginable. Zohran Mamdani
had just been elected Demo­cratic nominee for the mayor of New York—a
jaw-dropping achievement for a politician who most voters in Amer­ica’s most
populous city had barely heard of a few months ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“In the words of Nelson Mandela, it always
seems impossible until it is done,” he told ecstatic supporters. “My friends,
we have done it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A self-declared democratic socialist whom
President Trump has branded a “100% Communist Lunatic”, Mamdani had beaten the
man who polls suggested would sail to the nomination — Andrew Cuomo, scion of a
storied political dynasty and governor of New York state from 2011-21.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“This is the biggest upset in American
political history since Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Demo­cratic
presidential primary,” says Trip Yang, a New York-based political strate­gist.
“No one saw this coming.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Others, such as Ross Barkan, a col­umnist
at New York magazine, were less surprised. He’s known Mamdani since 2017, when
he hired him to run his campaign for a seat in the New York State senate: from
the start, Barkan says, he was impressed by his “charisma and verve”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I’m not shocked because I knew Zohran was
incredibly talented ... and I saw that the moment I met him,” he adds. “Did I
know he’d be on the trajec­tory to be mayor of New York City by the time he was
34 years old? No! No one could have foreseen that. But I knew he had great
potential.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mamdani may be popular on the left — but
elsewhere he’s a hate figure. Republicans have branded him a dan­gerous
radical, while some Jewish lead­ers worry about his strident criticism of
Israel, which he’s accused of “genocide” in Gaza. Law and order types note he
once called for the police to be defunded. Wall Street financiers say his
populist policies will trigger a stampede of capital out of New York.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“New York City under Mamdani is about to
become much more dangerous and economically unviable,” said bil­lionaire hedge
fund manager Bill Ack­man on X, as he offered to finance a cen­trist
challenger. “Socialism has no place in the economic capital of our country.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But among leftwing Democrats, he has
inspired nothing short of adulation. His megawatt smile, viral TikToks, and
laser-like focus on a key theme — New York’s affordability crisis — have
ensured him a legion of fans. Young vot­ers have lapped up his policy prescrip­tions
— a freeze on rents and a tax hike on the wealthy to finance free buses,
universal child care and city-owned gro­cery stores.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“My commitment is about delivering a city
that is not only affordable to each and every New Yorker, but is one that each
and every New Yorker feels proud of living in,” he told the Financial Times in
an interview earlier this month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Experts say Mamdani has become a vehicle
for discontent with a liberal establishment that has turned its back on workers
and the squeezed middle class. “He has managed to capitalise on the huge hunger
for generational change in the Democratic party post-Biden and the anger with
the old guard,” says one Democratic strategist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But politics tells only half the story,
according to Ali Najmi, a lawyer who has known Mamdani for 10 years and now
serves as his chief counsel. In his telling, the candidate’s trump cards are
his warm, engaging personality, his “emo­tional intelligence” and
“authenticity”. “Even if you disagree with him, you’re still going to like
him,” he says.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Zohran Kwame Mamdani was born in Kampala,
Uganda, in 1991 to Mira Nair, the celebrated Indian-American film­maker, and
Mahmood Mamdani, a Ugandan-Asian academic, and moved to New York City at the
age of seven.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>According to Barkan, his parents instilled
in him a keen awareness of ine­quality and injustice. “He grew up in privilege
.. . but unlike a lot of people with that kind of background, he’s always been
concerned about those less fortunate than himself,” Barkan says.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One of his first jobs out of college was
working as a housing counsellor, “help­ing low-income homeowners of colour
across Queens fight off eviction”, according to his official biography. He also
dabbled in hip-hop, though by his own admission he was never more than a
“B-list rapper”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the mid-2010s he started to get involved
in political campaigns, impressing colleagues with his strong work ethic. “He
exudes that New York hustle,” says Najmi. “I don’t think there’s anyone in
politics who can out­work him.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Barkan found this out to his cost. Dur­ing
his run for the Senate, he would often slip back to campaign HQ to rest after
spending the morning hours can­vassing. But “Zohran would not let me sit down,”
he recalls. “I would get at most a few minutes.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In 2020 Mamdani himself was elected to the
New York State Assembly, repre­senting the 36th district in the borough of
Queens. He was re-elected twice, in 2022 and 2024. But few could have pre­dicted
how his career would take off the following year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If he wins in the general election in
November, he would become the first Muslim mayor of America’s most popu­lous
city, and its youngest in more than 100 years. But he’s no shoo-in. He’ll have
to beat Cuomo, who is expected to run as an independent, as is Eric Adams, the
incumbent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Meanwhile, Ackman has vowed to do his best
to stop him. Allies like Najmi brush off that challenge. “There’s not enough
money to stop Zohran,” he says.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Gold glitters as mistrust spreads</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Some European MPs have sounded a discordant note by
demanding their bullion be repatriated from the US</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A decade ago, I asked officials at the New
York Federal Reserve if I could peek at their gold reserves. They refused point
blank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The reason? Fed officials have long taken
pride in having the world’s biggest gold vault, dug 80ft down into Manhat­tan’s
bedrock. But they prefer to keep it discreet, partly because many of the
vault’s 507,000 bars belong to countries such as Germany and Italy. Silence was
literally golden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Now, however, a discordant note has been
sounded. In recent weeks, politi­cians in Germany and Italy have demanded the
repatriation of their gold bars, worth an estimated $245bn. So have others. “We
are very concerned about [US President Donald] Trump tampering with the Federal
Reserve Bank’s independence,” explains the Taxpayers Association of Europe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Neither the Fed nor European govern­ments
seem minded to act, and there are no signs of bullion moving east. On the
contrary, gold has flooded into, not out of, America since Trump’s election,
prompting speculation that US govern­ment agencies, like private investors,
might be stockpiling it (although there is no public proof of that).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Either way, what is indisputable is that
these repatriation appeals are a sign of spreading mistrust. The reason those
bars were placed in New York vaults in the first place is that America’s allies
have hitherto assumed that Washington was a responsible leader of the west —
and the dollar-based finance system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Now, however, figures in the Trump team —
including Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Scott
Bessent, Treasury secretary — are chafing against the “cost” of this sys­tem.
Thus the question that investors need to ask is what other countries might do
if trade wars spawn capital battles as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In Asia, this debate is already under way,
as investors look for diversifica­tion. One sign is surging gold purchases.
Another is that recent unusual price movements in Hong Kong markets sug­gest a
reluctance to buy dollar assets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Meanwhile, Chinese officials are hail­ing
the rising use of the renminbi in trade invoicing, and developing a CrossBorder
Interbank Payment System (Cips) to challenge the US-controlled Swift interbank
payments system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Investors also need to watch the socalled
mBridge initiative, a cross-border central bank digital currency project
launched in 2023 by the Bank for Inter­national Settlements. Last year Wash­ington
forced the BIS to withdraw from this, leaving China in control. I suspect this
is an own goal by the US.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Europe, by contrast, has been fairly
passive thus far. However, figures like Francois Heisbourg, a key European
adviser, are urging preparation for a “post-American Europe”. And while this
has already sparked pledges of higher military spending, the focus is now also
shifting to “geoeconomics”, or the idea that statecraft must drive industrial
policy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>However, analysts such as Elmar Hellendoorn,
at the Atlantic Council, want to go further, with a policy of “geofi­nance”
too. After all, he argues, Europe is vulnerable since it not only relies on
dollar finance, but is also buffeted by speculative capital flows, due to financialisation
of its economy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Thus “large parts of the European economy
are now under the strong influence, if not the direct control, of Wall Street
firms, which are ultimately subject to US laws and Washington’s financial
statecraft”, he frets. Indeed, Enrico Letta, the former Italian prime minister,
fears that Europe is becoming a “financial colony” of the US.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Can this change? The European Com­mission
is talking baby steps in that direction, by accelerating efforts to cre­ate a
single European capital market. Central banks across Europe are also developing
cross-border digital curren­cies and the European Central Bank itself is
building a digital euro. That sets up a fascinating policy contest with
Washington, which is embracing dollar­based stablecoins instead — partly
because Bessent thinks this will create trillions of dollars of new demand for
Treasuries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>However, these efforts still seem far too
timid to actually create a “global euro moment”, to quote Christine Lagarde,
ECB president And that seems unlikely to change unless a crisis hits, be that a
loss of market confidence in the dollar (perhaps due to fiscal jitters) or
extreme aggression by the US towards Europe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hence why those Manhattan gold vaults
matter: if such crises do ever materialise, it is easy to imagine a sce­nario
in which American leaders (at best) will insist on using that bullion as
collateral for dollar swaps or (at worst) as a tool for political coercion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Germany’s Bundesbank, for its part,
discounts that risk — in public at least. “We have no doubt that the New York
Fed is a trustworthy and reliable partner for the safekeeping of our gold
reserves,” it tells the FT. Almost certainly so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But the debate shows that once unim­aginable
scenarios are at least being imagined. Reclaiming gold is a rational move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Centrica is set to take a 15 per cent stake
in the UK’s Sizewell C nuclear project after years of delay and months of drawnout
negotiations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>All sides are keen to reach a final
investment decision before parlia­ment’s recess on July 21, according to people
familiar with the discussions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The final cost of Sizewell — only the
second new nuclear plant built in a gen­eration in Britain — could be close to
£40bn, the Financial Times reported in January, based on assumptions from
industry experts. Both the government and Sizewell’s management have rejected
that figure although no new estimate has been given.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The planned investment by Centrica means
that the FTSE 100 energy com­pany behind British Gas would have the same size
stake in the Suffolk project as French state-owned energy group EDF, which has
progressively reduced its position to 15 per cent. Centrica already holds a 20
per cent stake in the parent company of the entity that operates EDF’s existing
nuclear assets in the UK. Centrica and EDF declined to comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The investment in Sizewell could still come
in time for French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to London for an
Anglo-French summit on July 8. However, timetables have slipped, according to
the people familiar with the situation, putting that goal in doubt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Brookfield Asset Management is still in
talks about a similar investment in Sizewell C and could be prepared to take a
larger stake than Centrica, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Brookfield declined to comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Apollo, the US private capital group, said
last week that it would provide £4.5bn in financing to EDF to support the
French group’s other main invest­ment in a UK nuclear power plant, at Hinkley
Point C in Somerset.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The government is focusing on nuclear power
to help Britain’s transi­tion to low-carbon electricity with the energy
secretary, Ed Miliband, calling it a “golden age” for the energy source.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The government said in a statement: “By talking
back control of our energy we will protect family finances, boost energy
security, and tackle the climate crisis.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It added that 10,000 jobs will be cre­ated
through building Sizewell C. It pledged £11.5bn of new state funding for the
plant this month, talking taxpayer investment so far to £17.8bn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The project claims it will provide 7 per
cent of UK energy needs for at least 60 years and power 6mn homes as well as
creating 70,000 jobs across the supply chain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sizewell C was initially proposed by EDF
and China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) but the government owns about 84
per cent of the project after removing CGN in 2022 over concerns about Chinese
influence, spending £679mn of taxpayer funds to buy out its stake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The British sports-car maker, controlled by
Chinese carmaker Geely, has strug­gled to pay its suppliers in recent weeks,
according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, bringing production
to a temporary halt at its Hethel plant in Norfolic for about a month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The lossmaking company aims to stop
production for good at the plant — its only manufacturing base in the UK — as
soon as next year, the people added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In a statement to the Financial Times,
Lotus said that it had paused production from mid-May to manage inventories
amid supply chain issues related to US tariffs. The company and Matt Windle,
head of Lotus Cars Em'ope, declined to comment further on “a rumour”. Geely
also declined to comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For the April to June quarter, Lotus
Technology reported an operating loss of $103mn, compared with a loss of $233mn
from a year earlier, while it delivered 1,274 vehicles, down 42 per cent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Geely took a 51 per cent stake in Lotus in
2017, as part of a deal to invest in Malaysian owner Proton. Its investment was
seen as a lifetime after years of losses at the company, founded in Lon­don
in1948. The Chinese group invested around £3bn in new technology and factory
equipment, but switched</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>its focus to a new plant in Wuhan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Li Shufu, the billionaire founder behind
Geely, which also owns Volvo Cars and Polestar, has been unloading his global
assets and streamlining his core business since last year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>With Geely’s help, the company for years
has tried to revive the historic brand but it struggled with its pivot towards
high-end electric vehicles. That led to a series of management changes in
recent years with Windle taking over as its European head in May after prede­cessor
Dan Balmer left after less than a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>year. Its chief commercial officer Mike
Johnson also left the company in 2024.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Since its IPO in February of last year,

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Trump Mobile has backed away from the claim that its
golden smartphone will be “Made in the USA”, just a week after it was
announced.</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The phone network launched by the Trump

“brought to life right here in the USA” and “designed with Ameri­can values in

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Statements that the T1 phone would start

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Trump Mobile did not immediately respond to
a request for comment. The company previously stated that manu­facturing would
take place in Alabama, California and Florida.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>No mainstream smartphones are manufactured
in the US. A formal Made in America label requires “all or virtually all”

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The push by the Trump Organization — led by

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Long shadow of Epstein eventually seals Staley’s
‘inevitable’ downfall</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Former Barclays boss fails to quash a City ban for playing
down links with sex offender</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=601 height=290
src=" image017.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jes Staley conceded that it would have been
easier not to have been friends with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. At
no other time was that senti­ment, expressed during the former Bar­clays boss’s
cross-examination in a Lon­don courtroom in March, more true than on Thursday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The 68-year-old American found that he had
failed in his bid to overturn a life­time ban imposed on him by the UK’s
Financial Conduct Authority over his ties to Epstein, the dead financier and
prolific sex offender.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“The loss of his long-standing career is an
inevitable consequence,” read the judgment of the Upper Tribunal, which heard
Staley’s appeal against the FCA.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Staley’s appeal was a last-ditch attempt by
the banker to clear his name and salvage a four-decade career spent in large
part at JPMorgan Chase and Barclays, two of the world’s most important
financial institutions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Instead, the month-long trial brought some
uncomfortable truths to light for Staley, some of them excruciatingly per­sonal.
This was almost inevitable for a case that featured thousands of emails between
the banker and his paedophile client, including a cryptic reference to
fairytale characters such as “Snow White” paying a visit</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Staley in court admitted to extramari­tal
sex with an Epstein employee, and the tribunal heard how — in April 2009 as
Epstein was serving a sentence for soliciting a minor — Staley forwarded an
email from him to Staley’s daughter, referring to him as “Uncle Jeffrey”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If Staley hoped to distance himself from
Epstein’s shadow, the trial had the opposite effect. “I have no idea why Sta­ley
fought this,” said one banker. “Now every time a sentence is written about him,
Epstein will also get a mention.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As if this week could not get any worse for
Staley, he and Barclays now face the prospect of a US class action after a
judge ruled this week that a lawsuit from pension funds can proceed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They allege that they were misled over
Staley’s relationship with Epstein.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Barclays did not respond to a request
seeking comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It could lead to yet one more court­room in
which Staley is required to recount his relationship with the dead sex
offender.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In London, the courtrooms in the Rolls
Building have played host to many multimillion-pound commercial dis­putes. But
few other cases will have brought together a member of the Brit­ish royal
family, key figures in the UK political establishment, two of the most
systemically important institutions and the most notorious sexual predator in
recent memory; a testament to Epstein’s connections and influence in high soci­ety
both in the US and Europe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This was all down to a four-paragraph
letter signed by Barclays chair Nigel Higgins and sent to the FCA in October
2019, two months after Epstein’s death in a New York jail cell awaiting trial
on sex trafficking charges. The letter stated that Staley “did not have a close
rela­tionship” with Epstein and that his last contact with him was “well before
he joined Barclays in 2015”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That could have been the end of it. But
shortly after, the FCA received word from Staley’s former employer JPMor­gan —
where Staley had nurtured</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Epstein as a client — that it was in pos­session
of a trove of emails exchanged between the two men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The UK regulator asked the bank to hand
over the evidence and, after a fouryear investigation, banned Staley from
holding senior positions in financial services and fined him £1.8mn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The tribunal concluded on Thursday that the
FCA was correct to find that Sta­ley had recklessly misled it. It was the first
time the regulator had banned a bank CEO for actions taken on his watch. His
behaviour represented a “serious failure of judgment” and he had “acted without
integrity”, the tribunal concluded. Still, it ordered Staley’s fine reduced by
almost 40 per cent to £l.lmn to reflect the fact that Barclays had not allowed
Staley to receive deferred shares he was entitled to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Timothy Herrington, the presiding judge,
delivered a scathing indictment of Staley’s evidence, some of which “lacked
credibility”, and highlighted instances in which the banker’s witness
statements contradicted what he then said on the stand, not least around the
nature of his relationship with Epstein.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>FCA officials privately expressed relief to
finally get a favourable ruling from Judge Herrington, who is retiring after
years of harshly criticising the watchdog, most recently when the tri­bunal
overturned its ban of three Julius Baer executives in2023.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One former senior FCA official called the
verdict “a solid result” but added that “it remains baffling why Staley brought
this case which has damaged his reputation and must have left him out of pocket
despite the reduction in the financial penalty”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Although Staley has two weeks to decide
whether to appeal, FCA director Therese Chambers could barely hide the agency’s
triumphant mood in her offi­cial response to the ruling. She said the former
Barclays boss had shown “a seri­ous lack of integrity” and had “hoped that the
truth would never come to light and that he would get away with it”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Staley said in a statement that he was
“disappointed by the outcome and the time it took for this process to play
out”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He added: “I have worked tirelessly for my
prior employers for the entirety of my career; I am proud of the support I gave
to many individuals during that career and the strategy I developed to help
Barclays when it faced immense challenges.”</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>The eternal dilemma of how to tax the super-rich</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>It is becoming harder to keep wealthy nomads and ordinary
voters happy</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Asked in 2006 whether he risked fomenting
class war by questioning the unfairness of the tax system, Warren Buffett
responded: “There’s class war­fare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich
class, that’s making war, and we’re win­ning.” Nearly 20 years on, the struggle
continues, and the dilemma for politi­cians caught in the middle is more acute
than ever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Switzerland is facing a referendum this
autumn on a 50 per cent inherit­ance tax, based on a 2022 proposal by its
far-left Young Socialists. In New York City, left-wing Democrat Zohran Mamdani
seems set to win the party’s mayoral primary, running on a programme that
includes raising taxes on the rich to fund free buses and childcare. The UK has
scared away some wealthy foreign­ers by abolishing its attractive non-dom
regime and making their global assets liable to inheritance tax.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Elsewhere politicians are clamouring to
attract the rich. Nearly 70,000 wealthy people have applied for the $5mn golden
Trump Card, which grants foreigners legal residency in the US. Italy is still
benefiting from an inflow of rich expats, talking advantage of its flat tax on
their foreign income, despite hav­ing doubled the annual levy last year to
€200,000. Dubai, Monaco and others continue to lure multimillionaires eager to
minimise their taxes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Life has become marginally more tire­some
for the wealthy. The end of bank­ing secrecy and improved information exchange
between tax authorities mean they can no longer park their capital in tax
havens and live somewhere else. Instead, they may have to shift their res­idency.
But by paying for the best legal and accounting advice available, they can
still largely pick and choose their tax rate and decamp to the next most alluring
enclave when a government tries to squeeze more income from them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Such high-end nomadism can be con­sidered
undignified. One of the privi­leges of extreme wealth is that you can pay to
live anywhere, instead of having to scurry around the globe chasing a few
percentage points of tax advantage. Indeed, billionaires have an interest in
funding public services, if only to ensure local policing for their properties
and adequate roads for their limousines, not to mention the increasing need for
mili­tary defences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Levelling the manicured fiscal playing
field for the super-rich would require international co-operation. The idea of
a 2 per cent blanket annual levy on billion­aires’ wealth was discussed at last
year’s G20 summit in Brazil, which pledged to “engage cooperatively to ensure
that ultra-high-net-worth individuals are effectively taxed”. But, while
advocates believe the plan still has momentum, that was before Donald Trump
returned to disrupt the world order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The argument for setting policy to attract
wealthy residents is that they bring investment and spend more than ordinary
taxpayers locally. This increases the take from consumption taxes. They also
back philanthropic causes. Rich and non-richthen rub along.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But governments are facing demo­graphic
change, low growth and the increasing costs of welfare, defence and climate
change mitigation. They are highly vulnerable to the counteraccusa­tion that
rich residents who are unrooted and uninterested in the local commu­nity simply
push up property prices and push out “ordinary working families” to whom
politicians appeal for votes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A lack of transparency and data make it
hard for policymakers to perform the sensible cost-benefit analysis that might
justify whether, how, and how much to tax the rich. The politics of greed and
envy fills the vacuum. If such tension and inequality cannot be resolved, then
expect more skirmishes in the class war, from Bern to Brooklyn.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Why is the right in thrall to fantasy literature?</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Society sttucttires our choices but the resulting
frustration feeds a yearning for magical rings</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=602 height=351 id="Picture 1"
src=" image018.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni
founded a conservative political conference named for a hero of a 1979
bestselling fantasy novel, used to cosplay as a hobbit, and in 2023 had a
museum exhibition commissioned about JRR Tolkien. Peter Thiel, the
Trump-supporting and democracy-sceptic tech billion­aire, leads a Silicon
Valley trend of company names derived from <i>The Lord of the Rings,</i> from
his own data intelligence group Palantir (magical stones found in Middle-earth)
to the weapons maker Anduril (a Tolkien sword). US vice-president JD Vance has
said his conservatism was influ­enced by both Tolkien and CS Lewis, author of
the Narnia books.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In other words, a fascination with fantasy
literature unites European nationalist conservatives, Trump tech bros, and the
Maga movement. Is this a coincidence? Or does something about fantasy fit the
rightwing mind unusually well?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the Italian case, the fantasy fan­dom
has been “more psychological than political”, says Salvatore Vas­sallo,
political science professor at the University of Bologna. It was impor­tant
when Meloni and her entourage were young and their section of the right was
excluded from the political mainstream by its baggage of fascist “cultural
references they could not express” in public.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Fantasy as publicly palatable ersatz
reactionary philosophy, then? To be sure, many themes in this literary canon
would seem to fit that bill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For example, it is easy to see how medieval
social hierarchy and essentialist racial categorisation, both com­mon to
fantasy worlds, could appeal to reactionary world views. It is also easy to see
the draw of the traditional and the ritualistic for those recoiling from
modernity. (Vassallo says that Meloni and others’ love for Tolkien was “con­gruent
with something they thought about themselves: &quot;pure’ people strug­gling
for values they appreciated but that were undervalued by others around them”.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But some of these observations are cheap
shots. After all, much fantasy can be spun the other way: heroes defy their
social hierarchies; fellowships across racial lines defeat evil. A sup­posed
aesthetic dislike for modernity has no place in Silicon Valley’s techno­-optimism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The clue, I think, rather lies in how
fantasy tends to the heroic. These are stories of personal persistence in the
face of Manichean adversity. They are stories where virtue wins; where indi­viduals
— if they can make the right choices, adopt the right values, follow the right
instincts — beat the system. They are, one might say, stories of the triumph of
the will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That aligns nicely with populism. It
supports the idea that troubles in peo­ple’s lives are caused by malign forces
and that certain special individuals can take those enemies on and win. Both
notions underpin the rhetoric offered by populists for why people (“the”
people, no less) should vote for them. “I am your retribution”, as Don­ald
Trump has said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Populism can be right or left. But in
another way, the fantasy genre’s tri­umph of the will is (as befits the term)
easier for right-wing populists to run with. It sublimates a dread of being
determined by society’s impersonal structures and a wish for our own choices
and values to shape the world around us. It reflects a desire for con­trol,
power, and a transparent mecha­nism from individual choice to social effect — a
desire, in short, for an epic world rather than the modern one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Fantasy represents less a return to a
premodern idyll, then, than a fulfil­ment of the freedom the Enlighten­ment
promised but social complexity took away. This is harder for the left to buy
into, for social structure is what the left is all about. On the personal
level, leftwing existentialists may want to break the grip of social
expectations. But politically, the left embraces the primary importance of
social struc­ture and sets out to shape it, while the right aims to leave it in
place (in reac­tionary versions) or destroy it (in more libertarian versions).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Those pure rightwing dreams are destined to
fail. We live in modernity whether we like it or not; society inevi­tably
structures our choices. But is it surprising if the resulting frustration feeds
a yearning for magical rings and amulets — or powerful but hard-tofathom
technologies?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There is, however, another lesson to be
found in fantasy literature. A deep structure binds people and nature together
in Ursula Le Guin’s Earthsea series, for example. These are works about the
limits of what individual power can achieve, and how it must be used to restore
balance and reinforce structures rather than blast through them. Perhaps
Giorgia, Peter, JD and their friends should read more fan­tasy, not less.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>ChatGPT outage taught this AI dabbler a valuable lesson</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Like a lot of people, I’ve been dabbling
with OpenAI’s ChatGPT with varying seriousness for about 12 months.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Make me a 12-week marathon training plan”,
“Create me a six-week marathon training plan”, “Make a photo of me as the next
Pope”, “Is it possible to run a marathon without any training?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When the platform went kaput this month, I
was midway through writing an application for a voluntary role with an academic
magazine. I’ve scoffed at accounts of students using artificial intelligence to
get through college, deriding them for only cheating themselves. In my own much
superior and honest scholarly pursuits, I only ever used it to source articles
... or plan ... and sometimes reference ... or clean up those long sentences
that don’t really go anywhere, nor make the point you want to make, but roll on
and on for far too long, eating up word count</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As a result of the blackout, however, I
ended up with two very different halves of an application. The first, produced
with ChatGPT’s help, sounded like something I’d written, if you ignored a few
of the more exotic word choices and overlooked the boxticking style of the
answers. It did everything the question had asked of it,and it wasn’t
necessarily a fabrication.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The second wasn’t as polished.
Pulitzer-worthy accounts of my leadership and prowess in adversity made way for
honest accounts of my achievements. Sentences were clipped and to the point. At
the end, I realised there were a few ideas that I’d missed but just couldn’t
shoehorn them in. But it was definitely me talking about me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>An obsession with performance is
continuously being maximised, from schools to the workplace to public services.
But at what cost? Tim Harford’s Undercover Economist column “Shared values over
profit” (Spectrum, June 7) and his account of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Alasdair MacIntyre’s “tale of two fishing
crews”, illustrated the perils of this fascination excellently. The first crew
is driven by nothing but profit. The second allows time for the cultivation of
character and human connection within the team, yet often comes out on top.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>ChatGPT’s outage opened my own eyes to how
I’d sleepwalked, slowly but surely, into believing maximum utility was somehow
better than sticking to my values. This dilemma isn’t just an issue for
business; it’s a challenge for individuals too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It is challenging to write a profile of

wrong, and it gives the Biden administration a pass.</span></p>

government focus on damaging your company, as the Biden administration did to
Meta, the experience is brutal (our much-smaller company once had a similar
experience). Your reporter states that President Joe Biden’s White House

Trade Commission’s lawsuit aiming at breaking up Meta. Relentless pressure from
the US government has consequences (Elon Musk, who voted for Biden in 2020, may
have had a similar reaction to his own treatment).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I have never known anyone less affected by

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Your interview with Emily Bender (Lunch

software engineering has made me sceptical of the claims made by IT leaders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For at least the last 15 years, gullible
politicians have urged that all children should learn to code. Apparently one
use of AI is accelerating the rate at which software engineers can write code.
Talking to colleagues at a recent company reunion, they described how an AI
could be prompted to assemble code from GitHub. But the prompts had to be very
carefully composed to get any sensible outcome.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Code generators have been in existence
since the debut of assembler languages in the mid-1950s. The high-level
languages of the late 1950s were initially sold as code generators. However all
of this misses the point: 80 per cent of the effort in any software engineering
project is analysis, design, testing, documentation and implementation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But at least children will be liberated
from the meaningless task of implementing algorithms in some obsolete scripting
language.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Robert Armstrong’s full-throated indictment
of monogramming anything “except a napkin or towel” (Style, Life &amp; Arts,

went: one should take pity on the man who monograms his shirt, for he is the
fellow who lacks a valet or domestic servant to launder his shirts at home.
Without such, he must rely on the washerwoman down the road. The monogram
informs said laundress to which house the shirts should be returned.</span></p>

of the greatest member of the great group, Brian Wilson (The Life of a Song,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“God Only Knows” is one of those songs
that, no matter who covers it, will always best be known for the lush original
version that Wilson (and his brother Carl with his lead vocal) gave us. Yet in
the US it was actually released as the B-side of “Wouldn’t It Be Nice”, which
not only sounded more of a rock song but did not have a potentially contentious
title referring to the Almighty. That, it was thought, mattered among
conservative Christians in the US.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Anyway, “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” was a
commercial success there, reaching number 8 in the Billboard charts. Having
“God” in a title mattered not at all in the UK where “God Only Knows” was
released as the A-side and leapt to number 2 in the Record Retailer charts,
being kept out of the top spot only by the Beatles’ children’s song, “Yellow
Submarine”, backed by the cheerless but haunting Eleanor Rigby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Wouldn’t It Be Nice” sold many more copies
in the much bigger American records market than “God Only Knows” did in the UK

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Although I believe it should never be used

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>However, I don’t think that its falling out
of favour is to do with an “in-yourface” emphasis replacing a nuanced approach,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I believe the reason is far simpler.

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Exit of North America and Europe boss comes as EV group’s
sales decline</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One of Elon Musk’s top lieutenants has left
his job at Tesla amid plunging sales and a pivot to autonomous driving,
artificial intelligence and robotics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Omead Afshar, who was promoted to run sales
and operations in North America and Europe last year, has left his role,
according to two people familiar with the decision. Jenna Ferrua, director of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>North American human resources, has also
departed from the company, they said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tesla, Afshar and Ferrua did not respond to
a request for comment. Bloomberg first reported the moves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Afshar’s departure comes at a difficult
time for Tesla as its sales and earnings decline. It has suffered from a lack
of new models, increased competition — in particular in China — and a consumer backlash
against Musk’s rightwing political activism in Europe and support of President
Donald Trump.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tesla’s worldwide EV deliveries fell 13 per
cent in the first quarter, and its net income plunged 71 per cent. That
prompted Musk to promise to “allocat[e] far more of my time to Tesla” and
reduce the time he spends in Washington. His so-called Department of Government
Efficiency has been controversially slashing government jobs and spending.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Musk has since left his government role and
publicly clashed with the president. However, Tesla has been unable to reverse
the trend, with sales in the UK and Europe declining 28 per cent in May, the
fifth monthly fall in a row. The EV maker will next week report global delivery
numbers for the second quarter, with analysts forecasting another double-digit
fall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Afshar has worked for Tesla since 2017,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He has been described as “firefighter”and
“executioner” for the world’s richest man, being moved across Musk’s various
companies to solve tough problems and conduct mass lay-offs, the Financial
Times has previously reported.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In late 2022, he was part of the
“transition team” that fired more than 7,500 people at Twitter — now rebranded
as X — and was given the nickname “the Elon whisperer” by colleagues because of
his ability to read the mood of the mercurial billionaire. Last year, he helped
undertake a 10 per cent reduction in Tesla’s workforce, shedding
about14,000jobs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Musk is conducting a broader overhaul of
the EV maker, betting its future on autonomous driving powered by artificial
intelligence and a humanoid robot called Optimus. Last week, Tesla started a

eventually lead to owners being able to rent their cars out via a ride hailing
app when not in use.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Meta hopes star hire Wang will be a catalyst for Al growth</span></h2>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Well-connected: Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang has a busy
social calendar that includes meetings with world leaders and appearances at
A-list events, something Meta hopes to leverage </span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mark Zuckerberg is betting more than $14bn
that a well-connected 28-year-old is the catalyst his company needs to catch up
with rivals racing to develop and commercialise artificial intelligence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Meta chief struck a deal last week to
buy 49 per cent of data labelling business Scale AI and hire its leader,
Alexandr Wang. Zuckerberg paid $14.3bn, marginally ahead of Scale’s last
valuation. But ownership of the start-up is “basically incidental”, according
to one Scale investor. The real prize was Wang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>An executive at one of Meta’s biggest
rivals said the move came after Zuckerberg decided Wang was the “wartime CEO”
he needed at the centre of the Big Tech group’s “superintelligence” lab — at a
time Meta was falling behind its AI rivals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A maths prodigy and the child of two
Chinese physicists, Wang, who co-founded Scale aged 19, is neither a celebrated
AI researcher nor a top engineer. According to a dozen people who have worked
with and for Wang, or invested in Scale, he is a highly effective operator who
has close connections across Silicon Valley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“There are very few companies that have
deep relationships with every top research team: there’s Scale and Nvidia, and
[Nvidia boss] Jensen [Huang] probably wouldn’t take the job,” said Dan Levine,
a partner at venture capital firm Accel who was one of the first investors in
Scale and remains on the company’s board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Zuckerberg is hoping that Wang’s star power
will draw away the best talent from rivals such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
and Safe Superintelligence (SSI) — the start-up headed by ex-OpenAI chief
scientist Ilya Sutskever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Meta is in talks to hire Dan Gross, one of
SSI’s co-founders, and his investing partner Nat Friedman, said a person with
knowledge of the matter. The discussions, which were first reported by The
Information, are at an advanced stage and poaching the pair would represent a
coup for Meta’s revamped AI division.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Gross and Friedman did not respond to a
request for comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Wang<sup>5</sup>s real gift, according to
multiple people who have worked with him, is an ability to cultivate powerful
allies both within Silicon Valley and beyond. His social calendar has
interspersed meetings with world leaders including Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel
Macron and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Narendra Modi, with trips to New York’s Met
Gala and Formula 1 races.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>His confidants include OpenAI chief and one
time housemate Sam Altman, the ChatGPT maker’s former chief technology officer
Mira Murati, and Michael Kratsios, President Donald Trump’s technology adviser.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Wang has long idolised Zuckerberg, said a
person familiar with the matter, adding that Scale had sought venture funding
from Accel in part because it was an early Facebook investor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For staff at Scale — who have joked
internally that the company would take years to go public because of its high
valuation — the deal is a welcome windfall. Staff in Meta’s generative AI team
are less impressed, said a person close to the company, citing doubts over
Wang’s technical prowess.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Meta is far from a neutral broker in the AI
race, and Wang’s ability to pull in favours might be shortlived. His new post
puts him in a war for talent against the likes of Altman and Murati, who
founded her own AI start-up called Thinking Machines last year. Altman said
this week that Meta had attempted to poach OpenAI developers with the promise
of $100mn sign-on bonuses and even higher pay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The massive outlay on new employees is an
admission that Meta’s existing AI strategy was stuttering. The company’s latest
release, Llama 4, underwhelmed on a number of independent performance benchmarks.
Wang’s title, and his relation to Yann LeCun — the computer scientist who leads
Meta’s fundamental AI research efforts — has not yet been determined, according
to the company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“This is the great bet: the most important
thing short term is the research team they assemble quickly,” said someone
close to Scale. “They’re making incredible offers and are trying to hire a
talented team as soon as possible. Alex knows all of these people ... It’s
almost like a heist.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Others who know Wang see opportunism behind
the relentless network building. “Wang is an operator, he wants to make as much
money as possible and make as big a name for himself as possible,” said one
former employee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“He wants his name on everything, even when
he isn’t across it or hasn’t done the work,” said another person who has worked
closely with Wang on a number of projects. Scale contested that
characterisation, describing Wang as hard-working and conscientious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>At Scale, Wang proved adept at reading the
market and political winds. The start-up initially focused on serving companies
training autonomous vehicles, before pivoting in 2019 to focus more on AI. It
quickly became the most prominent of a group of companies doing the unglamorous
work of labelling and categorising data used to train AI tools such as OpenAI’s
ChatGPT.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That has involved hiring more than 100,000
“gig” workers, many in the developing world, via a subsidiary called Remotasks.
It has more recently used subject experts to train and test models in highly
specialised domains. Scale said most of its “contributors” are now based in the
US.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Scale has pursued new business with the US
government and helped companies build AI applications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That business is growing fast, according to
a person close to Scale, but the bulk of its $870mn in revenue last year came
from labelling data for the biggest generative AI companies, including Meta.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Alex is never happy with his team, never
happy with himself. When I met him as a 19-year-old I noticed his intelligence,
but missed his relentless drive,” said one early investor in Scale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Wang has also become a trusted messenger in
Washington DC thanks to his adroit policy stances, such as extreme hawkishness
on China and an advocacy for “merit-based” hiring over diversity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Scale’s fate is now unclear. New chief
executive Jason Droege said the Meta deal, which valued Scale at $29bn,
validated the company’s approach and was “not a pivot or a winding down”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We have an exceptional team, a clear
vision, and the resources to achieve truly remarkable things,” he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the near term, Scale is fighting to
retain its biggest customers, and reassure them that their data will be
ringfenced from Meta. OpenAI and Google have already signalled they will wean
themselves off Scale’s services.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Scale’s business is going to collapse, no
one wants to work with a company Meta owns 49 per cent of, so [Meta] had to pay
what investors valued the entire company at in the last round,” said one of the
start-up’s backers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Scale said the company<sup>1</sup>s
relationships with key customers remain strong, adding that Meta’s investment
indicates there is real value in the remaining business. OpenAI said the
company had been in the process of moving from Scale for the past few months.
Google declined to comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Someone close to the company was more
bullish about Scale’s future without Wang. “Our customers can’t really leave
us,” they said. “We’re in a war and [Scale is] the arms dealer.” <i>George
