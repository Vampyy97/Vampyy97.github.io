pharma, has delivered thousands of jobs, colossal corporation tax receipts and
budget surpluses. But Trump’s tariffs pose a threat.</p><p class="MsoNormal">At first glance, Ringaskiddy looks like any other quiet
village on Ireland’s south coast. But it has one claim to fame: the sprawling
Pfizer campus that became ground zero of the country’s lucrative pharmaceutical
production industry.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US multinational decided in 1969 to establish its first
Irish plant in what had been a sleepy fishing village on the edge of Cork
Harbour, investing $10bn there and in three other locations across the country
in the decades since.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Rivals followed Pfizer’s lead, turning County Cork — and
Ireland as a whole — into a major hub for US drugs groups. A similar story has
played out in tech, with US companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft and
Apple setting up European headquarters or large operations in the country. The
investment from US multinationals into two of Ireland’s champion industries has
delivered thousands of jobs, colossal corporation tax receipts and, in the past
few years, breathtaking budget surpluses.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The result is that a country that had been one of the
poorest in Europe, and went spectacularly bust 15 years ago, is now
extraordinarily wealthy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To the envy of other EU states, economic growth has been
faster than normal for four years in a row, according to the Irish Fiscal
Advisory Council (Ifac), an independent budget watchdog. More money flowed in
last year when the European Court of Justice ordered Apple to pay €14bn in back
taxes from a now-defunct sweetheart deal.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But the source of Ireland’s recent wealth is now under
threat.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This week’s trade deal with President Donald Trump will
impose 15 per cent tariffs on most US imports of goods from the EU,
intensifying fears that American investment in Ireland will slow down.
Pharmaceuticals — which had not previously been subject to tariffs — will be
included for the first time.</p><p class="MsoNormal">And this all comes as the country is under pressure to
deliver on critical infrastructure challenges from housing to energy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The Trump thing has shone a light really clearly on our
over‑dependence on [foreign direct investment],” says Owen Reidy, general
secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents one in four
of the country’s workers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“[If] you strip out the FDI and look under the bonnet, the
domestic economy is not good,” he adds. Compared to similar countries “we're
performing badly on productivity, we're performing badly on investment... We've
taken our eye off the ball as a state.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US‑EU deal, struck on Sunday, has put an end to
Trump’s threat of a much stiffer 30 per cent tariff on goods and eased fears —
for now — of separate levies as high as 200 per cent on pharmaceuticals.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This is “not good news for Ireland”, says Glenn Reynolds,
head of indirect tax at KPMG in Ireland, adding that the full picture will only
become clear once the US concludes a separate investigation into the pharma
sector.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In Ringaskiddy, where the active ingredient for erectile
dysfunction drug Viagra is manufactured alongside other in‑demand
products, workers are jittery about what the future holds.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We’re being told [by management] ‘we aren’t worried about
Trump’ but drug companies are investing billions in the US to build new plants
to keep him happy,” says one Pfizer employee who asked not to be named. “These
guys won’t spend money here when there’s uncertainty.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Their concerns are not misplaced.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Although Pfizer and other multinationals are currently
delivering eye‑popping corporate taxes, forecast to be close to €30bn
this year, Ireland remains vulnerable. The country could easily find itself
“potentially caught in the middle” of a worsening transatlantic trade
relationship, the government admitted in its summer economic statement released
this month.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Even before the trade deal was announced, it warned that
“the public finances are not as healthy as the headline figures suggest.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Without its corporation tax haul, Ireland would have run
budget deficits every year since 2008. And the country is acutely exposed: just
10 groups pay more than half of all corporation tax receipts and three
companies, widely believed to include Pfizer, account for a third of them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Warnings from finance minister Paschal Donohoe, who has long
highlighted the volatility of such receipts and the perils of relying on them,
have suddenly started to sound much starker.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“It is difficult to give an exact point at which I expect a
decline will happen,” he said at a recent press conference, “but I am convinced
a decline will take place.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">His summer reading includes Ray Dalio’s <i>How Countries Go
Broke</i>.</p><p class="MsoNormal">With tariffs in place, officials expect this year’s budget
surplus to be “considerably lower”. The government has said it could yet
“recalibrate its fiscal strategy for 2026, due to be presented on October 7, in
order to ensure that the public finances remain on a sustainable trajectory.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Seamus Coffey, who chairs Ifac, is more blunt: “Political
storm clouds are gathering.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">For now, Ireland’s economy is holding up well. “I’m
surprised by how strong activity has remained since ‘liberation day’,” says
Fergal O’Brien, executive director of Ibec, Ireland’s biggest business lobby,
referring to Trump’s name for the blizzard of tariff threats he unveiled on
April 2.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The country, once known for exporting its people during
times of crisis, is enjoying record levels of employment. “I can’t get workers
— that’s a sign of a thriving economy,” says Tom Scriven, who owns a
construction and property management business near Ringaskiddy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But the country has a fast‑growing — and fast‑ageing
— population. At 39, the median age is the second‑lowest in the EU, but
the ratio of people of working age to over‑65s is set to halve by 2050.
This will cost the government an extra €16bn each year, according to an
official report last year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">And even with today’s demographics, essential public
infrastructure is simply failing to keep up.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The government — a coalition between the centrist Fianna
Fáil and more conservative Fine Gael — has repeatedly missed its house‑building
targets. Investments in data centres around Dublin have been forced to stop
because the ageing power grid is under too much strain.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Although the state water utility has been given the green
light for vital new drainage works in parts of Dublin, other projects face
delays, potentially limiting drinking water in the capital. Despite an
abundance of wind, offshore renewable energy projects are trudging through
Ireland’s planning system and the country is falling behind on its 2030 climate
goals, risking EU fines as high as €26bn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, the government has been spending generously: Ifac
noted it is already more than four times over last year’s budget estimates even
before it announced new spending and investment plans.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the past five years, the cost of running the country has
ballooned by 58 per cent and the social welfare bill has grown by 30 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">On top of that, the government has unveiled a sweeping
€102.4bn capital investment plan for the next five years — the largest in Irish
history — in an attempt to tackle its bottlenecks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Donohoe insists Ireland is stashing money away as it braces
for more global uncertainty. He says that a string of giveaway budgets, which
included generous subsidies for residential electricity bills and extra
childcare payments to help consumers with the cost of living, will not be
repeated in next year’s budget.</p><p class="MsoNormal">He expects Ireland to have saved €16bn by the end of this
year in two sovereign wealth funds that the government set up to make use of
“windfall” corporation taxes — additional tax revenue that is far higher than
domestic production can explain.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This happens because multinational companies can book
profits in Ireland even on sales of their products abroad because their Irish
subsidiaries hold key intellectual property rights.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Dan O’Brien, chief economist at the Institute of
International and European Affairs, a Dublin think‑tank, is underwhelmed
by the €16bn in savings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“That’s a tenth of €160bn,” he says, referring to
corporation tax receipts in the past decade. “It’s been a policy failure not to
treat a much greater share of that revenue as windfall and put it into a
sovereign wealth fund.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Critics argue that Ireland should be using its windfalls to
counter its infrastructure deficits. The IMF estimates Ireland has
significantly less road, electricity, water, sewage, school and hospital
infrastructure than similar small, high‑income EU peers — and what it has
is of worse quality.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But Ireland’s problem is not money, it is “implementation”,
says one senior official who blames “siloed” government decision making. Action
plans, including on housing and competitiveness, are due in the coming weeks,
but “when everything is a priority, nothing is a priority,” he adds.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Civil servants drafted a two-page document a month after the
budget was unveiled last October highlighting energy, water, transport and
housing as key focuses. But it went nowhere, the official says.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, productivity in the construction sector is low
and Ireland slid three places in the 2025 IMD World Competitiveness Rankings
compared to the year before.</p><p class="MsoNormal">With Germany announcing €46bn in tax breaks and Singapore
implementing tax changes, Anne Gunnell, director of tax policy at the Irish Tax
Institute, says “nothing should distract [the Irish government] from a laser‑like
focus on competitiveness” to remain attractive to FDI.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ireland’s economy has crashed before. But even after the so‑called
Celtic Tiger boom of the 1990s and 2000s ended in a banking collapse and the
global financial crisis, requiring an IMF and EU bailout in 2010, Ireland built
an extensive motorway network.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“What have we got to show for it this time?” asks the
official.</p><p class="MsoNormal">With tariffs looming, the government is working on
diversifying its economy and reducing its vulnerability to future shocks. One
target is semiconductor companies, which officials are hoping to lure in with a
new “Silicon Ireland” initiative, a plan that will be fleshed out in the coming
weeks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This is likely to include three sites that could be used for
fabrication plants, probably in County Galway in the west of Ireland. While the
government has not confirmed any details, a report in the Business Post
newspaper says that it is planning to spend €3.2bn. “Have the site ready and
they will come,” one minister tells the FT.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ireland is also renewing an early bet on financial services
— an industry it began developing in the late 1980s.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There is reason for optimism. Exchange traded funds based in
Ireland now represent more than 70 per cent of the total European market. “The
performance of our industry is not correlated with either domestic demand or
necessarily the broader economy. So it makes it a very good diversifier,” says
Pat Lardner, chief executive of industry association Irish Funds.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Officials are also examining regulatory changes to promote
the sector's appeal, says William Fogarty, a tax partner with the Maples Group
law firm. “We've had much more positive engagement with policymakers in Ireland
in the past six months on the development of [an updated] Irish financial
services regime than personally I have seen in the last five to 10 years.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ireland has the ability to succeed at diversifying its
economy, but that is all the more reason to focus on key fundamentals, says
O’Brien of Ibec.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Look at the share of global industries that Ireland has
already managed to attract,” he says. “But if we want to put ourselves forward
as a global centre for the semiconductor industry, we need to be able to show
that we've got good energy security, affordability, that we're able to cope
with demand — all that stuff really matters.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The good news for Ireland is that more than two-thirds of US
firms in Ireland plan to keep investing for the next five years, according to a
new survey by the American Chamber of Commerce.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Pharma will remain important: Irish sales to the US were
higher in the first four months of 2025 than in the whole of last year as
companies rushed to export before any tariffs hit.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A “substantial amount of the growth in exports” also came
from weight loss and diabetes drugs, the central bank noted recently, pointing
to rising demand in the US and elsewhere to keep sales going.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ironically, it was Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed in
2017, that turbocharged Ireland’s corporation tax profits by inadvertently
providing incentives for pharma companies to shift their IP into Ireland from
tax havens.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But while the US president has lauded Ireland’s smarts for
cashing in so handsomely, he has made it clear that he wants American companies
to bring more production and profits back home.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump’s recently passed signature “big beautiful bill” could
make “winning new projects much more difficult for Ireland” because of the
incentives to invest in the US, warns O’Brien.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Veteran economist Colm McCarthy, who chaired an Irish
government review addressing the 2008 financial crisis, is pragmatic about
Ireland’s tax bonanza.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“It’s just a bonus... a lottery win,” he says. “Eventually,
someone else will win — and we’ve been told who it’s going to be — the IRS. We
have to be prepared for our good luck to run out.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
