European supermarket buying alliances for fraught price negotiations that sent
its beer sales down in the first half of the year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Dutch brewer yesterday reported a 4.7 per cent fall in
sales volumes of European beer in its first half after retailers pulled the
brand from shelves when it stuck to planned price rises despite weak consumer
demand.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Heineken said the negotiations — primarily in France, the
Netherlands, Germany and Spain — with groups of retailers that band together to
drive down prices had dragged on longer than expected.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Heineken’s share price was down nearly 8.5 per cent
yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We see a hardening in these negotiations, which is a point
of concern,” said Dolf van den Brink, Heineken chief executive. “But we felt
that we are fighting for the long-term financial viability of our sector.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The brewer's results come at a time of rising tension
between branded goods suppliers and supermarkets, which are less willing to
raise prices for fear of losing customers after a period of soaring costs for
everyday goods.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Van den Brink said that negotiations were becoming tougher
because retailers were more concerned about affordability and because of the
growing strength of buying groups in Europe.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“These buying groups become more powerful, more dominant,
because you're no longer negotiating with an individual retailer in one
country,” he said. “They're really coming together, and you can be delisted in
one country because of a conflict triggered in another country.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Van den Brink said this was “a point of concern” and that
Heineken had asked the Dutch government to “keep an eye on” it. The results
also follow the EU’s trade deal with the US, announced on Sunday, which will
result in tariffs of 15 per cent on most imports from the bloc.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Van den Brink said Heineken was not currently shifting its
manufacturing to the US to offset that impact, with 95 per cent of its products
produced in local breweries for local consumers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The only meaningful exception is the US market, and
therefore we are now suffering the impact of these tariffs,” van den Brink
said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“But... this is something that we anticipated and that we
can mitigate for.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The brewer's net revenues rose 2.1 per cent to €14.2bn in
the first half of the year, beating expectations, while overall sales volumes
fell 1.2 per cent, lower than expected. Organic operating profit increased 7.4
per cent in the same period.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company reaffirmed its operating profit guidance of
between 4 and 8 per cent for the full year.</p></body></html>
