media sites to include YouTube, despite warnings from its parent, Alphabet,
that it would consider legal action over such a move. Canberra passed
legislation late last year aimed at preventing anyone under the age of 16 from
registering to join social media platforms, including Instagram, X, TikTok,
Facebook and Snapchat. The law puts the onus on technology companies to enforce
the age limit or face significant fines of up to A$50mn ($33mn).</p><p class="MsoNormal">YouTube, which argues it is a video-sharing service rather
than a social media company, was exempt, due to its role in education and
children’s entertainment. However, Australia’s e-safety commissioner, Julie
Inman Grant, said last month that YouTube should be included in the ban, after
research showed it was the most frequently cited platform where children had
encountered harmful content. Alphabet has written to the government to warn
that it is considering its legal position.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Communications minister Anika Wells said yesterday that the
e-safety commissioner’s evidence “cannot be ignored”. She said that parents
have struggled to know what is best for their children online and that it was
like trying to teach youngsters how to swim in the open sea rather than a local
pool. “We can’t control the ocean, but we can police the sharks, and that is
why we will not be intimidated by legal threats when this is a genuine fight
for the well-being of Australian kids,” she said at a press conference.</p><p class="MsoNormal">YouTube said the decision to include it in the social media
ban was a “reversal” from a previous public commitment to exempt it that was
passed in legislation last year. “We will consider next steps and will continue
to engage with the government,’ it said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The ban — which comes into force in December — will not stop
children from accessing YouTube. It will stop under-16s from registering for an
account, limiting their access to inappropriate content and avoiding
personalised recommendations. “We want kids to know who they are before
platforms assume who they are,” Wells said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Social media sites will need to deactivate existing accounts
held by users under the age of 16 by December and take “reasonable steps” to
ensure that children do not find easy ways to work around the ban. Prime
Minister Anthony Albanese said yesterday he was set to hold a meeting about the
social media ban on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September,
after other countries expressed interest in the legislation. “This is not an
Australian experience; it is a common experience,” he said.</p></body></html>
