retreat will speed passage”, Report, July 23) that senior members of the UK
government persist in waging a cynical culture war that vilifies endangered
species such as bats as imaginary barriers to economic growth and
infrastructure development.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In fact, the government's own impact assessment of the
planning and infrastructure bill found no evidence to substantiate the tired
trope that environmental protections are a blocker to development.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This month’s amendments to the planning bill were a welcome
first step in ensuring it delivers for both nature and development. Yet such
needless and harmful rhetoric from Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, further
erodes the already fragile confidence in the government to uphold its recently
restated commitment to safeguard our natural environment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sally Hayns<br/>
