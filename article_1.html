AIME WILLIAMS — WASHINGTON<br/>
ANDY BOUNDS — BRUSSELS</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US and EU have struck a trade deal that will impose 15
per cent tariffs on EU products, Donald Trump said yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The EU has agreed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars
on additional American energy products and weapons as part of the deal, the US
president said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The agreement, which is set to avoid a transatlantic trade
war, was struck during a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von
der Leyen at Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The meeting, which lasted around an hour, saw the sides
agree a deal that was largely hashed out by negotiators earlier last week and
met the EU’s key benchmark of a blanket 15 per cent tariff.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Earlier in the day Trump said he wanted to end the bloc’s
“unfair” trade relationship with the US. “We should give it a shot,” Trump said
ahead of the negotiations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sitting next to von der Leyen, Trump said the US-EU trade
relationship was “unfair to the United States … a one-sided relationship”. He
added: “Both sides want fairness.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">After reaching the deal, he said that “this is probably the
biggest deal ever reached in any capacity, trade or beyond trade”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump said the EU would spend an additional $750bn on US
energy products, invest $600bn in the US and buy “a vast amount” in US military
equipment worth “hundreds of billions of dollars”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US president said the US would put tariffs of 15 per
cent on EU goods, including automobiles, in exchange for the bloc “opening up
their countries at zero tariff”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Speaking after the US president, von der Leyen said the new
tariff rate would be “all inclusive”, and described the arrangement as a “good
deal” that had been “tough” to reach.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Before the meeting von der Leyen said that the EU’s trade
surplus in goods with the US, which hit almost €200bn last year, needed to be
cut.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We have to rebalance it,” she said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal is a major victory for Trump, who has spent months
forcing America’s allies into bruising negotiations by threatening steep
tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But US trading partners have expressed concern that, even
when they strike agreements with Trump to lower his tariffs, they face
uncertainty over future levies on sectors including pharmaceuticals, chips and
aerospace.</p><p class="MsoNormal">EU steel and aluminium imports are exempted from the deal.
Trump said the levies, which he has set at 50 per cent for most countries
across the world, would not be tackled until after an initial agreement with
the EU, dashing the industries’ hopes for an early and low tariff quota.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump had threatened to impose 30 per cent tariffs on EU
products imported into the US if no deal was finalised by August 1, a move that
would almost certainly have sparked retaliation by the bloc and a transatlantic
trade war.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The EU had prepared a retaliatory package of tariffs of up
to 30 per cent against €92bn of US exports if it could not reach an agreement.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Speaking after the deal was announced, US commerce secretary
Howard Lutnick said the US would unveil new tariffs on chips as a result of its
national security probe into the sector in two weeks.</p></body></html>
