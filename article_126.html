for younger dealers keen on collaboration. By Tim Schneider</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">For more than a decade, sceptics have questioned the
paradigm dominating the business of art galleries: an intercontinental network
of permanent physical locations, a programme spanning scores of artists and
estates and a year-round treadmill of art fairs. But more than two years into
the current art-market contraction, the debate has transformed from a lively
topic for panel discussions and cocktail parties to a matter of existential
risk.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Now, as prominent baby boomer gallerists exit earlier than
expected, many of their potential successors are instead working to completely
redefine success in the field.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some of the recent casualties have been shuttered
voluntarily, such as the New York investor-turned-dealer Adam Lindemann's
13-year-old gallery Venus Over Manhattan. Others have had little choice,
including Peres Projects, the once-tastemaking international gallery declared
insolvent in a German court this spring.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But no closure has had more impact than Blum, the
international gallery carried forward by Tim Blum after his business partner
Jeff Poe stepped away in 2023. Blum announced on July 1 that the business would
be "sunsetting" more than three decades after it was co-founded as
Blum &amp; Poe in Los Angeles. He described his rationale as "burnout at
every level" caused by a system intent on growing "ever outward,
upward, onward" after the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The winding-down of Blum — whose footprint included a Los
Angeles headquarters, a gallery in Tokyo and a Manhattan expansion previously
scheduled to debut this autumn — has rekindled anxieties about the dealer
sector's sustainability. For instance, Blum's peer Stuart Shave, the founder of
the London- and Paris-based Modern Art gallery, both rejects the notion of a
"dysfunctional system" and acknowledges the perpetual-growth model
took off before its effects were understood.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"We are in the midst of a decade-long experiment to see
if those extremes of scale are even sustainable, not just for dealers but for
artists also," he says.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet conversations with multiple millennial and Gen Z dealers
suggest Blum's closure has done little to scare the younger generations away
from building empires mainly because they were uninterested in that path in the
first place.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Tim Blum's experience does not squarely resonate with
mine — it couldn't," says Bridget Donahue, who founded her namesake
gallery in New York in 2015. "Early on we established a clear-eyed
commitment to five shows a year and one to two art fairs. This was a reaction
to my tenure working in bigger galleries; I remember that unenjoyable pace of
work. We made a corrective move to protect myself and my artists from the
burnout that Tim describes."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Donahue has combined her self-imposed limits on scale and
velocity with a priority on what she calls "like-minded, collaborative
relationships" with other dealers in different geographies. Together,
these strategies shape much of the art world's post-imperial model.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Matthew Brown, who opened his eponymous gallery in Los
Angeles in 2019 at age 23, says Blum "was quite important for me" as
he "changed the landscape of the city for art". Six years after its
founding, Brown's own business comprises two locations in Los Angeles and a
third in Manhattan's Tribeca neighbourhood; it also champions rising stars such
as Sasha Gordon and Dan Herschlein alongside eminences such as Carroll Dunham.
Despite lamenting the loss of Blum's programme, however, Brown says its closing
"didn't change my plans at all".</p><p class="MsoNormal">"I don't want to speak for other dealers, but my
feeling is that there is more interest in transparency, experimentation and
building platforms that reflect the present," he says.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Asked about appealing alternative models, Brown tellingly
cites Art Collaboration Kyoto, a hybrid event in which Japan-based dealers
invite international peers to share a fair booth—a way to minimise costs while
maximising networking opportunities abroad.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"The recent movements in the art world have, if
anything, reinforced our gameplan," says Jacob Hyman, one of the four
partners in Amanita Gallery in Manhattan. "While the renown and ubiquity
of the empire-sized galleries are certainly appealing, perhaps more desirable
is the wieldy intimacy of, say, the Matthew Marks or Xavier Hufkens
dimension."</p><p class="MsoNormal">When Hyman, now aged 30, considers the trade-offs involved
in sustaining a global colossus, he does so from experience. He joined
Amanita's management team after four years in sales at Gagosian and now
prioritises close co-operation with other dealers and a personalised approach.
If or when the gallery expands beyond its two current locations in Manhattan,
he says, "I want to know our artists really well and for our collectors to
feel like they are part of the story."</p><p class="MsoNormal">"The new model I see emerging is people who, rather
than trying to build empires, are trying to build communities," says Marc
Spiegler, a strategic consultant for art and culture businesses and the former
global director of Art Basel. "They're not trying to build a client base
of hundreds of people. They're trying to build a core client base so tight and
coherent that a gallerist could literally invite them to a cocktail party at
their house."</p><p class="MsoNormal">This strategy's precedents include Sadie Coles. Founded in
London in the 1990s, her programme has grown to encompass around 60 artists and
two permanent locations (with a new space set to open in October). Coles has
also pioneered multiple initiatives to engage younger dealers and
audiences—most notably The Shop, a space dedicated to hosting emerging
galleries and creative ventures, and Gargle, an ongoing series of
cross-disciplinary happenings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet careful planning is not what kept this evolution rooted
in London, Coles says. "Looking through the lens of now, a controllable
overhead looks smart, but the scale of my gallery is instinctual rather than
rational. I always wanted the gallery to be a size that allows me to be
completely hands-on with everything, something you cannot do if you have
multiple locations across the globe."</p><p class="MsoNormal">This mentality continues echoing into the next generations
of gallerists.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Rejecting the empire-building model for me boils down
to: do you grow into essentially becoming a CFO, where your life is being on
airplanes getting between your multiple locations to have team meetings about
your sales targets instead of ever being in an artist's studio connecting to
what got you into art in the first place?" says Vanessa Carlos, the
director of London's Carlos/Ishikawa gallery and the founder of the
international gallery-share initiative Condo. "I would've just gone for
investment banking as a career if that was the goal."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Carlos adds that she and other millennials who opened
galleries in the 2010s largely rejected the pressure of the growth-at-all costs
model. Instead, they "chose to lean into community, collaboration and DIY
initiatives. But 10 years later, so few of us have survived financially."</p><p class="MsoNormal">She hopes the next generation of gallerists may fare better,
partly owing to how adeptly they have professionalised the perspective of their
millennial forebears. "It's almost like we were a first wave of gritty
gentrifiers and they are the second, polished wave."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Tim Schneider is founder of The Gray Market.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
