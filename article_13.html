over</h2><p class="MsoNormal">ALEXANDRA HEAL AND ANTOINE GARA — NEW YORK</p><p class="MsoNormal">Private equity investors are opting to cash out rather than
roll over their investments when buyout managers seek to hold on to portfolio
companies beyond the life of their funds.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Between 85 and 92 per cent of investors have this year
chosen to sell rather than remain invested when private equity groups transfer
a portfolio company to a so-called continuation vehicle, rather than exiting
through a traditional sale or initial public offering — up from 75–80 per cent
last year, according to investment bank Houlihan Lokey.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Private equity firms have flocked to the structures, which
allow them to hold on to portfolio companies beyond the typical 10-year
lifespan of a fund by bringing in new investors and offering existing ones the
chance to sell their stake.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Buyout managers argue that continuation vehicles allow them
to retain their best assets and capture further value creation. But their
critics say the vehicles’ popularity is in part because sellers have struggled
to get high enough valuations for assets from external buyers in a tricky
dealmaking environment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Many private equity backers have instead been taking the
opportunity to sell their stakes in the portfolio company, rather than rolling
their holdings into the new fund, according to Matt Swain, global co-head of
equity capital solutions at Houlihan Lokey.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Investors in private equity funds, such as pension funds and
endowments, were “welcoming distributions from [continuation vehicles] with
open arms” because they had “experienced a dearth of liquidity in recent
years”, Swain said, with a lack of traditional exits. Last year private capital
firms sold $62bn of assets into continuation funds, according to advisory firm
Campbell Lutyens, up almost 50 per cent on the year before.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Swain predicted that this year 10–15 per cent of all private
equity exits could be done through such vehicles. Jefferies recently calculated
that the vehicles had led to almost 20 per cent of sales across the industry in
the first half of the year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Continuation vehicles usually combine capital from three
sources: specialist secondaries funds dedicated to buying existing private
equity assets; cash committed by the private equity manager; and money rolled
over by the backers of the original buyout fund.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The vehicles can either house just one portfolio company —
an approach used on prize assets but one that results in a concentrated risk
profile — or multiple assets, where the risk is more diverse but the assets can
include underperforming bets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Last year at least two continuation vehicles failed, the
first large blow-ups in the industry. Wheel Pros, a car parts maker on which
buyout group Clearlake had reaped nearly $1bn in profits on selling it into a
continuation fund, filed for bankruptcy, leaving the equity investors in the
newer fund with large losses.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Mustafa Siddiqui, founder of secondaries investment firm SQ
Capital, said continuation vehicles were used where a buyout fund did not want
“to give the future growth in value to someone else” and for “lemons” that they
could not sell to a conventional buyer.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
