Tucker, pictured. A relatable problem, probably, to many British boards. BP
just named a new chair; Prudential seeks one too.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Finding the right balance of experience and availability can
be a real chore. Yet, if HSBC were based on the other side of the Atlantic,
there might be a simple solution: give the job to the chief executive.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nothing provokes pearl-clutching among UK investors and
governance watchers as much as the idea of combining the chair and CEO roles.
It’s simply not the done thing. Shareholder advisory service ISS calls it “a
serious breach of good practice” given the chair’s importance in keeping the
chief in check.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The UK’s corporate governance code asks companies to comply
with the principle of separating the two jobs, or explain. Almost all comply.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Americans aren't fully convinced. About two-fifths of
S&amp;P 500 companies combine the two roles, including six of the biggest 10 by
market capitalisation. And while the number is falling, shareholders still
don’t seem to care much. This year, companies fielded 31 proposals to split the
CEO and chair role, down from 44 in 2024, according to Freshfields. Not one
received majority support; the average vote was 31 per cent in favour.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Supreme leaders are a recipe for misfortune. But separate
chairs aren't the only way to hold the CEO’s feet to the fire. JPMorgan, like
nearly two-thirds of S&amp;P 500 companies that combine the jobs according to
the Conference Board/ESGAUGE, argues this is the role of the lead independent
director, whose job is to act as a liaison for shareholders and generally check
the board is running as it ought to.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Having an independent chair is no guarantee of a
well-behaved CEO either, as Tesla has amply shown. Putting too much emphasis on
the chair risks turning down the volume on the other members of the board, who
ought to be acting collectively to keep the company on track.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Better to have directors who are, say, tasked with making
annual site visits and reporting back to the board than one strong personality
who provides much of the impetus while others nod along.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Now is a good time for the UK to question long-held views.
The pressure is on to attract companies lured by US markets, where valuations
are higher and governance rules more flexible. Good governance should always
command a premium, but the idea that splitting CEO and chair roles is
sufficient — or really necessary — deserves debate.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
