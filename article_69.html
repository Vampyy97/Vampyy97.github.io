transfer deals to offload exposure from prime brokerage divisions, freeing up
cash to lend to hedge funds in pursuit of a bigger share of a booming market.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Morgan Stanley last year struck a deal with Blackstone to
transfer a portion of the risk on loans made by the bank’s prime brokerage unit
and release capital for more lending, people familiar with the transaction
said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal, which required Morgan Stanley to retain a portion
of the risk, provided the US investment bank regulatory capital relief and gave
the unit responsible for lending to hedge funds added firepower.</p><p class="MsoNormal">US banks have increasingly turned to credit risk transfers —
also known as synthetic risk transfers — to reduce the amount of capital they
must use to guard against losses on the loans they have underwritten since
domestic regulators blessed the deals in 2023.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But the use of SRTs for margin loans marks a jump from the
relatively vanilla corporate and consumer loans that have traditionally
underpinned the capital relief trades.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Banks have been searching for ways to gain that same relief
for their prime brokerage units, which have been a big profit centre as trading
activity has surged.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The way to think about SRTs is not strictly about
protecting the downside,” said Michael Shemi, the head of North America
structured credit at Guy Carpenter. “It’s the other way around: they are
designed to unlock the upside for banks. Banks pursue these transactions to
improve profitability and to facilitate growth in specific asset classes.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Other than Morgan Stanley’s deal with Blackstone, however,
US banks have mostly struggled to complete SRTs on margin loans, according to
more than half a dozen people who transact in the credit risk transfer market.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Margin loans allow hedge funds to supercharge their trading,
using the financing from banks’ prime brokerage units to buy stocks and bonds
or enter into swaps and derivatives transactions on borrowed money.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Banks are exposed if a big hedge fund fails to meet a margin
call and suffers large losses, inflicting losses on their prime brokerage
units.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Prime brokerage can be a particularly risky business and has
attracted political scrutiny since Archegos Capital Management’s implosion in
2021. Banks including Credit Suisse, Nomura and Morgan Stanley suffered more
than $10bn of combined losses tied to Archegos.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Banks have found it hard to complete SRTs on prime broking
loans in part because they often agree to strict confidentiality terms with
their clients and cannot reveal the underlying positions of the hedge funds.
Even describing them could reveal trade secrets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Positions can also change rapidly — given a hedge fund’s
typical trading patterns — meaning the collateral underlying the credit risk
transfer when it is first struck may change days or weeks later.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Instead, an investor must rely on their own view of a bank’s
prime brokerage business and its risk management policies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Banks that have struck these prime brokerage risk transfer
trades have offered so-called white lists to would-be investors and often
described which hedge funds make up the bulk of their exposure. The list
includes the names of hedge funds that could be included in the risk transfer.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For some money managers, that can be enough — especially if
they are separately invested with the hedge funds included on those white
lists.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In those cases, the money manager can then assess the risks
of the hedge fund’s trading book.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Even so, people familiar with the discussions said some
banks had found the transactions too expensive to complete</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
