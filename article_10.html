ahead of November’s presidential poll, handing the country’s far right its best
chance at winning power.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Chile, one of Latin America’s safest and wealthiest nations,
has suffered its first big wave of gang crime over the past five years, as
groups from Venezuela and elsewhere have expanded Chile’s previously niche
markets for drugs, human trafficking and extortion.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kidnappings, dismemberments and other once unheard-of
violent crimes have flooded local media and Chile’s murder rate has more than
doubled since 2015. Chileans have long ranked security among their top
concerns, but polls show the issue eclipses all others.</p><p class="MsoNormal">That has benefited José Antonio Kast, a politician on his
third run for president who has made a career criticising governments’ handling
of crime and immigration.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Arturo Squella, president of Kast’s Republicano party, told
the Financial Times: “Chileans can clearly see that the other competitive
candidates have not had the determination to tackle drug traffickers and
organised crime head on. They see that determination in José Antonio Kast.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kast promises to draw inspiration from El Salvador’s
President Nayib Bukele, and build a border barrier to keep out undocumented
migrants.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A poll by opinion research group Cadem in July projected
Kast to win 27 per cent of the vote, putting him just behind the leftwing
coalition’s candidate, Jeannette Jara, at 29 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But several other rightwingers jointly scored about 25 per
cent, and analysts say Kast would more easily pick up those votes in a run-off
in December, making the election his to lose.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kast and Jara have political baggage that may put off
moderate voters. Kast, a son of German immigrants and a father of nine, is a
defender of Chile’s divisive 20th-century rightwing dictator Augusto Pinochet.
Jara is a member of the Communist party, which supports authoritarian regimes
in Cuba and North Korea.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“A Pinochetista has never won an election in Chile, but
neither has a communist,” said Patricio Navia, a professor at New York
University. “This looks like an unprecedented election.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Crime, along with lacklustre economic growth, has battered
the popularity of leftist President Gabriel Boric, a former student leader. He
is barred from running for a second consecutive term under Chile’s
constitution. Jara was his labour minister.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Boric’s government devoted the first half of his term to
failed efforts to expand Chile’s welfare state and overhaul its constitution. A
later pivot to focus on security, which he now calls his “number one priority”,
was not enough to convince voters and his approval ratings have rarely risen
above 30 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Officials say the arrival of hundreds of thousands of
migrants from crisis-stricken Venezuela, combined with a pullback in state
presence during the pandemic lockdowns, has allowed poorly policed informal
settlements to blossom and created a pool of vulnerable people to exploit,
particularly in northern Chile.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Santiago has also changed. Downtown walls are still
plastered with graffiti from protests in 2019 over the cost of living. Informal
street vendors have proliferated and stores shut earlier.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Fatal shootings have frequently occurred in bustling
neighbourhoods around the capital’s Central Station and in July authorities
uncovered what appeared to be a “torture house” used by gangs. “Muggers used to
just take your cell phone, but now they’ll shoot you... people don’t go out at
night any more,” said Marco Gonzalez, who sells bathroom fixtures in the area
and plans to vote for Kast. “The government has been too weak to control it.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Boric’s government has increased security spending, passed
laws targeting organised crime and jailed hundreds of gang members, including
from Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The homicide rate has fallen slightly, from a peak of 6.7
per 100,000 residents in 2022 to six per 100,000 in 2024, and remains among the
lowest in Latin America. But other offences remain stubbornly high. A
government survey published in July found 5.8 per cent of Chileans had been the
victim of a violent crime last year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The state has intensely pursued these criminals ... and we
are achieving results,” security minister Luis Cordero said. “Of course, I
would like the results to come faster, but some will only be visible in the
medium or long term.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kast argues the government has not gone far enough. He vows
to strengthen legal protections for police officers who use force, and make it
easier to deport migrants for entering illegally.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Last year, Kast visited El Salvador’s 40,000-capacity
mega-jail, whose harsh conditions have become the centrepiece of Bukele’s
crackdown on gangs. Squella said they would import “all the elements that are
appropriate in Chile”, including cutting off imprisoned gang members’ contact
with the outside world.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We will reclaim the state’s right to use force, restore a
sense of authority, and make police work more proactive,” he added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Jara, meanwhile, has pledged to recover gang-controlled
neighbourhoods “by investing in infrastructure, culture and a permanent state
presence” and change banking laws to make it easier to track money laundering.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kast remains the favourite, but analysts said Jara, a
charismatic speaker who grew up in a working-class neighbourhood, was proving
to be an unexpectedly strong candidate.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“There’s a strong anti-elitism message within her, which has
worked in many countries recently,” said Robert Funk, an associate professor of
political science at the University of Chile.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
