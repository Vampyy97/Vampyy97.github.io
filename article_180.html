THEATRE</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="567" src="FT_files/image087.jpg" width="601"/></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="446" src="FT_files/image088.jpg" width="601"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">"You're not the judge of me!" cries Harry to his
mum in the midst of a fraught exchange. It's a charge levelled by many an irate
teenage child at a parent, only here it acquires formidable weight. In Suzie
Miller's <i>Inter Alia</i>, Jessica is indeed a judge and the friction
between her professional and personal roles will build to breaking point as the
play corkscrews into a sweaty-palmed nightmare.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Following on from Miller's blazing hit, <i>Prima Facie</i>,
it's another coruscating scrutiny of the shortcomings of the legal system when
it comes to rape, sexual assault and consent. Miller puts the system in the
dock and finds it wanting.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But she also digs deeper. This is a chilling study of the
difficulty of bringing up children against a backdrop of malign online
influence and violent pornography. Led by a tremendous performance from
Rosamund Pike, who never leaves the stage, it's immensely potent, if flawed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Again the focus is a successful female lawyer and again
Miller has written a fantastic role for a woman. In <i>Prima Facie</i>,
Tessa (played sensationally by Jodie Comer) is a defence barrister who is
thrust suddenly into the other side of the system when she is raped on a date.
Jessica in <i>Inter Alia</i> is a crown court judge, who has worked
her way up through a historically masculine environment and is still beset by
caveman attitudes. As the play begins, with a flourish of drums and electric
guitar (played by her son and husband), she rises up through the stage like a
rock goddess, mic in hand, ready to put down, with withering politeness, a
sexist lawyer in her court. She excels at knocking down victim-blaming
stereotypes from defence barristers; she knows how hard it is to secure a
guilty verdict in a rape case.</p><p class="MsoNormal">She is also a wife and mother, managing legal files
alongside frantic phone calls about missing shirts and dinner ingredients, and
worrying about her sensitive son who has been bullied. Pike is very funny as
she juggles wig, yellow Marigolds and slinky party frock, belting out drunken
karaoke one minute, handing down sentence the next and then shovelling plates
into the sink.</p><p class="MsoNormal">All this comes crashing together when Harry (Jasper Talbot),
who has just turned 18, attends a drunken party with disastrous consequences
and Jess is plunged into a quagmire of moral, legal and maternal guilt. She and
her KC husband Michael (Jamie Glover) know how to work the system in favour of
Harry's defence. They also know this means justice won't be served. Then there
is Harry, miserable, scared and ultimately tormented by guilt.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Huge questions surge across the stage about responsibility,
accountability, morality and justice. Justin Martin's hurtling production
conveys the sense of free-falling panic, while Miriam Buether's set — a
well-appointed kitchen surrounded by looming trees — smartly suggests today's
online equivalent of a threatening fairytale forest.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Miller's style, in which everything is filtered through
Jessica's churning mind, works well in plunging us into her nightmare. It is
limiting dramatically, however, sometimes too close to commentary and leaving
less room for the other characters, who feel as if they need more time,
particularly given the subject matter. But what is never in doubt is the
immense importance of what Miller is tackling or the power of Pike's
performance, which is simply superb.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Opening nights make her terribly jumpy," says
producer Horace Hardwick of his wife Madge in Top Hat. She wouldn’t have been
alone on opening night of Kathleen Marshall’s new production: an unexpectedly
slippery stage stopped the show within minutes, leading to an impromptu
prologue of floor swabbing and a floor-test as only musical theatre can do it:
dazzling spins, sizzling tap moves and a few high kicks for good measure. It
all seemed quite fitting for a show that boasts “Let’s Face the Music and
Dance” as one of its peerless numbers and only added to the general bonhomie of
the whole evening, which has all the delight — but, let’s be honest, also the
nutritional content — of a sweet summer sorbet.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The 1935 film revels in the pairing of Fred Astaire,
floating like chiffon on a breeze, and Ginger Rogers, famously doing everything
he did but “backwards and in high heels”. Adapted for the stage in 2011 by
Matthew White and Howard Jacques, it looks a little exposed. The plot is in the
same neighbourhood as some of Shakespeare’s mistaken identity comedies, though
it never summons quite the same enthusiasm for nuance and depth. Broadway star
Jerry, in London for a revue, falls for independent-spirited model Dale, but
due to a mix-up the two nearly miss their chance, leading to all sorts of
capers in Venice, a marriage that isn’t a marriage and a few lessons in
humility. That’s about it.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It’s Irving Berlin’s songs we’re really here for, and the
silky glory of those dance numbers. They are joyously delivered here, with
Marshall’s effervescent choreography kicking up a storm. Marshall directed and
choreographed the outstanding Anything Goes at the Barbican in 2021, and she is
expert in striking sparks off a stage. Phillip Attmore brings genuine charm to
Jerry — a sense that this self-assured man has actually met his match in Dale —
and he’s a dazzling dancer, perfecting that air of astonishment as his feet fly
sensationally almost without his bidding. Lucy St Louis is more than a match as
Dale: a feather-light dancer with a beautiful, crystal voice, she gives her
character a fine sense of self-worth.</p><p class="MsoNormal">They’re joined by Clive Carter, drolly stressed as Horace
and handling some groanworthy gags, and the formidable Sally Ann Triplett as a
Madge who could slice ice with a look. Alex Gibson-Giorgio revels in the
portrayal of an Italian fashion designer who is as authentic as pineapple on
pizza — all rrrrrrolling Rs and clicking heels. And James Clyde broods
enjoyably as Horace’s saturnine valet Bates, a kind of cross between Jeeves and
melancholy Jaques from Shakespeare’s As You Like It.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But it all begins to feel a little effortful in the second
half, as the narrative wanders into increasingly silly excesses, and even the
grace of “Cheek to Cheek” doesn’t quite lift it enough. It’s not up there,
then, with some of Chichester’s finest summer musicals — it doesn't have the
heft. But as an effervescent seasonal treat, it slips down nicely.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To September 6, cft.org.uk</p></body></html>
