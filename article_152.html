accounts to crypto wallets</h2><p class="MsoNormal">JPMorgan Chase customers will be able to connect their bank
accounts to their Coinbase wallets from next year, strengthening ties between
the cryptocurrency sector and traditional finance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The companies said yesterday their mutual customers would be
able to “seamlessly link” their Chase bank accounts with their Coinbase
accounts in order to buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. The partnership
“will give users more ways than ever to get into crypto.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The move underscores the deepening relationship being forged
between traditional banks and crypto companies, as lenders become more
comfortable with digital assets under Donald Trump’s administration.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US president has championed the crypto industry,
appointing friendly regulators and pushing forward laws that ease Wall Street’s
path to becoming involved with digital tokens. His family has backed several
crypto businesses.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Chase customers will be able to use their credit cards to
buy crypto through Coinbase from this autumn and transfer their credit card
points to their Coinbase accounts from next year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“This marks the first time a major credit card rewards
programme will be used to fund a crypto wallet,” the companies said, adding 100
credit card points will be worth $1 that can be used towards buying digital
assets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Banking’s embrace of digital assets marks a dramatic
contrast from its position less than a year ago. During Joe Biden’s
administration, crypto executives lambasted banks’ reluctance to work with them
and accused them of restricting retail traders’ ability to fund their accounts.
The crypto industry dubbed it “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Last week, PNC Bank said it was working with Coinbase to
allow the lender’s customers to trade crypto. Nasdaq-listed Coinbase, the
biggest US digital assets exchange, has been spearheading the push to change
Wall Street attitudes towards crypto.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Bernstein analysts wrote that the partnership means
“Coinbase is not just acquiring new customers but going where the customer
savings are.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Coinbase, led by chief executive Brian Armstrong, has spent
millions on lobbying in Washington. The group makes most of its revenues from
fees on crypto trading but is expanding into banking services, payments and
other areas to entrench itself into digital finance.</p></body></html>
