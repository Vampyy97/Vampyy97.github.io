Donald Trump announced the US would slap 25 per cent tariffs on imports from
India. The US president said New Delhi’s own levies were “among the highest in
the world” but later said the two countries were still negotiating, adding
“we'll see what happens.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The planned levy will come with an additional, unspecified,
penalty after Trump noted India had “always bought a majority of their military
equipment from Russia” and was its biggest energy buyer despite the Ukraine
