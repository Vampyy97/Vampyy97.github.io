defiance of Trump” (Report, July 28) underscores a remarkable paradox: at a
time when the EU is caving in to US trade demands — agreeing a one-sided deal
that imposes a 15 per cent tariff on most European goods exported to the US
while getting little in return — Brazil is standing its ground, not letting
itself be humiliated by Washington, which is threatening to impose a 50 per
cent tariff on Brazilian exports.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This paradox is only increased by the fact that while the US
runs a deficit in its trade in goods with the EU, it runs a surplus with
Brazil, a surplus that stood at $7.4bn in 2024.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The notion that an emerging economy and rising power is
willing to defy the arbitrary policy measures of the US, while the EU is
incapable of doing so, tells us much about the current state of world affairs.
That this is done by a country within the western hemisphere, the traditional
US sphere of influence, is even more revealing.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The fact is that there are no economic reasons for Donald
Trump to single out Brazil for punitive tariffs. The reasons are purely
political, as the White House comes out in support of the former president and
close Trump ally, Jair Bolsonaro, who faces charges of engineering a military
coup attempt in January 2023.</p><p class="MsoNormal">At a time when many countries (not just the EU) are running
for cover or outcompeting each other to comply with Washington’s demands,
Brazil takes a different tack. Structurally, Brazil is well-positioned to do
so, exporting $94bn of goods to China in 2024, versus $40bn to the US, and
being much less dependent on the US than a country like Mexico, or other
nations in the Caribbean and Central America.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Beyond economic flows, however, Brazil has traditionally
prized its national autonomy, and recently has embraced what with my colleagues
Carlos Fortin and Carlos Ominami we have called in a recent book “active
non-alignment”. This is a foreign policy approach that refuses to take sides in
the great power competition between the US and China, puts the national
interest front and centre, and makes choices in the international arena on an
ad hoc basis, depending on the matter at hand.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This is very much what transpires in the interview your
correspondent conducted with Celso Amorim, President Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva’s chief foreign affairs adviser. As the global south comes to the fore,
non-alignment is back with a vengeance, albeit in a new incarnation, as active
non-alignment — and Brazil is Exhibit A.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ambassador (r) Jorge Heine<br/>
