transatlantic divorce looming as the futures of Ukraine, Nato and trade
remained up in the air. With their beach holidays beckoning, European leaders
may now be taking a sigh of relief. The US president who called Nato obsolete,
promised to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours and declared the EU a foe, has
instead taken their side — for now.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But to placate Donald Trump’s instincts, Europe has had to
bow down and pay up, no fewer than three times. First for Nato, pledging
hundreds of billions to additional defence and security spending. Then for
Ukraine, committing to paying the US for weapons Ukraine needs. And this week
for trade, allowing the US to unilaterally multiply tariffs even as Europe
promises more than $1.3tn in purchases of American energy and weaponry, and in
investments on US soil.</p><p class="MsoNormal">European negotiators can point out that US tariffs for many
other countries are higher still, that European product and safety standards
remain in place, that US energy is a desirable alternative to Russian energy,
that weapons purchases are already booked under Nato plans, that European
investments into the US economy happen anyway and that the headline figures of
EU purchases are aspirational. Europe may be paying an acceptable price for
trade stability, provided Trump does not change his mind and the remaining grey
areas, including steel and pharmaceuticals, are spared punitive tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But Europe cannot hide from the fact that the Trump
administration has bullied it into submission. The leading multilateral free
trade block in the world has failed to stand up for trade. European Commission
president Ursula von der Leyen was even reduced to painting Europe as the
villain, parroting the false Trump narrative of zero-sum trade.</p><p class="MsoNormal">European countries together lack the economic strength, the
military power and the shared worldview to collectively stand up for common
values and interests. Europe cannot conduct a trade war with the US because it
is divided. It cannot afford one because it is weak. It cannot play the art of
the Trump trade deal, mixing geopolitics, hard power and ego, into the
technocratic process for which the EU is designed. America knew this. The rest
of the world knows it now. Europe’s relief is born in impotence and made of
humiliation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Psychologically, will this forced appeasement finally push
Europe to take itself seriously as a geopolitical power, or will it instead
entrench European division and dependence? The signs are not very promising.
European countries are committed to spending more on defence and security, but
incentivising common national procurement is the most European it gets. In the
meantime, three and a half years into a war of invasion, Europe is still
incapable of producing the critical weapons for Ukraine.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Deepening the European internal market as a gravitational
geopolitical force in energy, defence, communications and finance has been
powerfully advocated in influential reports but is gaining little political
traction. Addressing industrial decline is increasingly bringing back the past
of national state support, bypassing European market integration. Mobilising
more common European funds, perhaps the easiest way forward, is still a taboo,
as recent discussions on the next EU budget have once again demonstrated.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The single biggest European development of the year is the
re-emergence of Germany as a military actor, with a five-year plan to spend
more than €600bn on defence and security. But tellingly, the Merz government
embraces a “Made for Germany” philosophy, forgoing the opportunity to put a new
Germany at the heart of common European procurement, even with industrial
projects that could form the bedrock of a future European defence union.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the same vein, the recent Lancaster House Agreement
between the UK and France is a bilateral “entente industrielle” of old,
enabling both countries to occupy a position of national strength in a Europe
of security and defence, but not a building block for a bigger proto-European
project.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Jean Monnet said that “Europe will be forged in crises and
will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises”. His fellow EU
founding father, Paul-Henri Spaak, on the other hand, observed that “there are
only two types of states in Europe: small states, and small states that have
not yet realised that they are small”. If Europe’s humiliation is to end, its
leading nations must remember Spaak and relearn Monnet.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The writer is co-CEO of the Brussels-based Itinera Institute
