the purchase of a 50 per cent stake in one of the UK’s largest for-profit
universities as he seeks to create a global AI-focused education group.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Brightstar Capital Partners, the US buyout group Claure
joined this year, has agreed to buy the stake in Arden University for more than
$1bn, according to people briefed on the deal.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Arden, which says that it has 40,000 undergraduate and
graduate students in the UK, will begin offering UK-accredited degrees to
full-time students globally next year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Claure said he planned to use AI to translate Arden’s
curriculum for some 140 degrees into different languages, with the aim of
quickly expanding in the Middle East, Latin America and other parts of Europe,
including Spain.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“AI technology allows you to basically teach a class in
English and be able to deliver to many different students in over 150 different
languages,” said Claure. He also expected to use AI to offer students
individualised tutoring.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Claure said Arden would also seek to expand its enrolments
by offering UK student visa sponsorship to foreign students for its in-person
and remote-learning campuses in the UK. “We're going to be recruiting students
from all over the world that want to come to the UK to have an education,” said
Claure.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Arden generally focuses on professional degrees and its
curriculum offers a mixture of remote and on-campus learning for up to a fifth
of its classes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Brightstar is buying its 50 per cent stake from current
owner Global University Systems, a Dutch for-profit education conglomerate.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The private equity firm was founded by Andrew Weinberg,
Claure’s top aide at the Latin American telecoms group he sold to SoftBank in
2014. Brightstar was also the name of this telecoms group.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Claure, who later moved to SoftBank, subsequently led the
group’s efforts to merge Sprint with T-Mobile, and its international investment
operations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">He left SoftBank in 2022 amid difficult talks over a pay
deal. Lately he has focused on his family office, Claure Group. Claure will
become chair of Arden University and plans to announce AI-focused private
equity deals after joining Brightstar as a partner in April.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Brightstar manages more than $5bn in assets and has sold
billions of dollars in assets for large gains.</p></body></html>
