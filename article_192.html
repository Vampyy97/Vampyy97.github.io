encouraging that Britain’s Conservatives have asked him to cook up some new
policies. In a recent Substack post, he claims that a “confluence” of problems
dog the country. How true. Immigration is high and growth isn’t. Hear, hear.
Working-age benefits are out of control. I’m glad someone said it. As a
template for national change, Britain should look at the Meiji Restoration in
Japan.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Excuse me, what? In 1868, Japan dumped centuries of
feudalism and isolation to industrialise at speed. The capital was moved.
Conscript armies displaced the samurai. All this was done to prevent conquest
or subjugation at the hands of the high-tech west — the fate of much of Asia.
The Meiji Restoration was as dramatic a rupture as a large society has
undergone.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Britain, meanwhile, needs quicker GP appointments and
tighter spousal visa rules. It needs to punish people who steal mouthwash from
Boots. I don’t intend this as bathos. Nigel Farage is right to take “petty”
crime seriously, as is Robert Jenrick. But there really is no read-across from
the crisis-stricken Japan of the shoguns.</p><p class="MsoNormal">If O’Brien overdoes it, the hyperventilation in the wilder
corners of the British right has to be seen to be believed. Talk is of total
social breakdown and extreme measures to reverse it. Well, if Britain is
broken, I merely ask, “Compared to what?” The two possible answers are:
compared to other countries now and compared to Britain itself in the past.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Let us take these in turn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Which countries of similar size and complexity are in much
better shape than Britain? France is even more indebted and harder to reform.
Germany has been in recession for a couple of years. In all three countries,
the populist right — whose success is a proxy measure of public disaffection —
could plausibly end up in government at the next general election. In Italy, it
governs already. This isn’t the 1970s, when the UK stood out as the European
straggler.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Of course, a nation’s malaise is no easier to bear just
because others are experiencing their own. But it is prima facie evidence that
broader trends are at work than unique British decay.</p><p class="MsoNormal">If we are broken, who is whole? There is a case for
Australia as a well-governed mid-sized nation but British right-wingers are
reluctant to make it, as they would have to accept that a 31 per cent
foreign-born population (that is not a misprint) needn’t spell disaster.</p><p class="MsoNormal">And so to the longitudinal comparison: the one between
Britain now and yesteryear. In 1995, there were 20 million incidents of crime
in England and Wales. There were fewer than 9 million in 2024. Exclude fraud
and computer misuse, which didn’t feature in the Crime Survey until 2015, and
this falls to 4.6 million.</p><p class="MsoNormal">People are doubtful of statistics, and should be. But this
data would have to be extravagantly wrong for the preachers of social collapse
to be even remotely right. It would also have to be wrong around the world, as
the fall in crime since the 1990s is a (not well understood) international
trend.</p><p class="MsoNormal">When was the UK’s last blackout? Or three-day week? Far
fewer working days are lost to strikes than in the 1960s, 1970s or 1980s. It
wasn’t just efficiency that suffered back then, but trust between unionised and
non-unionised citizen.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Within my lifetime, the state was engaged in
counter-insurgency, mostly in Northern Ireland but London, Manchester and
elsewhere on the mainland suffered too. The national sport had become a
wasteland of casual violence and deathtrap stadiums. Set the riots of last
summer against those of 1981, 2001 and 2011. Community relations? I saw half a
dozen National Front logos per day as a child, etched into school desks and
sprayed on concrete underpasses. Give me 2025, thanks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">What makes nostalgia so hard to argue against is that it is
an ever-moving target. People pluck their favourite bits from different periods
— the homogenous culture of the 1950s, the industrial peace of the 1990s, the
rampant growth of the pre-crash noughties — and combine them into a single
fictitious moment. It makes it impossible for the present to “win”. Twenty
twenty-five has to go up against a Best Of, a compilation from the last century
or so.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Worse, bleakness about the present can be self-fulfilling,
as it encourages people to do rash things on the basis that life can’t get much
worse. (“Roll the dice” is a phrase doing the rounds.)</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hence Brexit. In O’Brien’s “confluence” of British problems,
being outside a gigantic single market in the nation’s own continent doesn’t
rate a mention. Round-the-clock misery and self-recrimination combined with
coyness about the biggest thing that Britain has done this century: that is
modern Conservatism to a dishonest tee.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Britain needs reform. Welfare, the European Convention on
Human Rights, the holy NHS: it is all due re-examination from first principles.
But the reason voters drag their feet about change is precisely that things
aren’t disastrous. If the economy is stagnant, it is not more so than in many
rich, ageing democracies. If the political class is mediocre and frivolous, it
is not venal. If the “feel” of urban life has coarsened since the pandemic, it
still rates well against the high-crime 1980s or against US cities today. For
now, Britain does not need turning upside down. Once these people are done with
it, though, I wonder.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="mailto:janan.ganesh@ft.com" target="_blank">janan.ganesh@ft.com</a></p></body></html>
