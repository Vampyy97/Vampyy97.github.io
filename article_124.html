yesterday as investors awaited a week of key corporate earnings, a string of
important economic data, and a US Federal Reserve meeting.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index was down 0.2 per cent by
early afternoon in New York after giving up small early gains, while the
tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Fed yesterday began its two-day policy meeting and will
give an update on benchmark interest rates today. Investors are expecting the
central bank to hold rates steady at 4.25-4.50 per cent but will be listening
closely for signals about how the Fed is weighing the early signs of inflation
from President Donald Trump's tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Markets are also waiting for heavyweight corporate results
with the “Magnificent Seven” megacap stocks — Meta and Microsoft reporting
today, and Apple and Amazon updating tomorrow.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the
currency against a basket of rivals, reached its highest level for five weeks,
rising 0.4 per cent. The dollar has rebounded this month — particularly against
the euro — following a series of US trade deals that have eased investor
concerns about a full-blown global trade war.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The short dollar trade is still a very consensus view, but
the more US equities rally and the more asset managers are drawn back into the
US markets after rotating some assets out in the first half of the year, the
harder it is for the dollar to fall,” said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at
Jefferies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The euro slid 0.5 per cent against the dollar to its lowest
level for a month, taking its losses since the weekend’s US-EU tariff deal to
1.8 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However, European stocks moved higher, largely reversing
Monday’s losses. The pan-regional Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up 0.3 per
cent, Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax rose 1 per cent and Paris’s Cac 40 advanced 0.7 per
cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Eurozone investors were also waiting for important GDP and
inflation figures this week for clues about how the economy is weathering the
early impact of tariffs from the US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In London, the benchmark FTSE 100 index firmed 0.6 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">US government debt rallied after data on American consumer
confidence was stronger than expected. Yields on 10-year US Treasuries fell 6
basis points to 4.56 per cent as investors snapped up the debt.</p></body></html>
