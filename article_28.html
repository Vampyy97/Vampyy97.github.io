game for Switch 2 — but does it justify buying the new console? By Tom Faber</p><p class="MsoNormal">A number of times in the two months since I got my Switch 2,
I've turned the console on, still buzzing with the excitement of a new toy,
clicked around the menus for a while, and then turned it off again. I couldn't
find anything exciting to play.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It’s common for new consoles to feel a little thin in terms
of games for their first year or two, but even by the industry’s meagre
standards, the Switch 2’s launch line-up was weak. It had one appealing
exclusive in Mario Kart World, which is fun for racing a few laps with friends
but doesn't invite long, deep sessions of play.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nor does the console offer a thrill in its hardware.
Nintendo has a reputation for thinking outside the box with playful hardware
innovations (such as the Wii's motion controls or the Switch’s TV/handheld
hybrid design), but the Switch 2 is a machine whose improvements feel
incremental rather than revolutionary.</p><p class="MsoNormal">So what is there to feel excited about? And for those on the
fence, is it worth buying the new console yet?</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nintendo’s answer to both of these questions has just
smashed through the wall in the form of Donkey Kong Bananza, a new game with
the Switch 2’s fortunes riding on its muscular, simian shoulders. It’s a 3D
platformer, a genre staple for the company, but also a surprise in that it
stars Donkey Kong, a B-tier Nintendo mascot, rather than a leading man such as
Mario or Link. As if to allay concerns, the normally tight-lipped Nintendo made
the unusual move of revealing who at the company was responsible for making the
game — the same team that made 2017’s Super Mario Odyssey, which set a modern
standard for the genre.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The DNA of Odyssey is abundantly clear in Bananza’s basic
formula. As Donkey Kong, you traverse large open worlds seeking hidden crystal
bananas, sometimes diving through portals for linear combat and platforming
challenges. The world design shows the developers firing on all cylinders, with
each space overflowing with clever secrets, beautiful details and stunning
vistas. Nintendo truly is gaming’s answer to golden-era Pixar — no other studio
is operating at this level of inspired, family-friendly game design.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Each of Nintendo’s banner 3D platformers has a central
gimmick, from the water jets of Super Mario Sunshine to the gravity-warping
planets of Super Mario Galaxy, and it’s here that the choice of Donkey Kong, a
character whose fists are larger than his brain, makes sense — Bananza is all
about destruction.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Whereas a Mario game has you balletically running and
jumping around a carefully sculpted environment, in Bananza you can just smash
through to the other side. Punch through mountains, pummel your way underground
and giddily terraform however you see fit.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As you progress through lush forests, alien moonscapes and
sunset canyons, you learn to use your destructive capabilities tactically. The
game encourages players to pay attention to the materiality of its world — each
area of the landscape has its own properties and hardness, from volcanic lava
to poisonous swamps, and you must combine these strategically to defeat enemies
and progress. Later you gain access to special animal transformations, the
titular “Bananzas”, which allow you to sprint, fly and — of course — punch even
harder.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Something about smashing through these beautiful landscapes
feels gloriously anarchic, and while Nintendo isn't the first to do it —
there’s Minecraft, and the smart demolition puzzler Teardown — it’s still a
surprise that a company known for tight control and careful design is willing
to give the player so much agency to deform terrain and reshape its game
worlds.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But this is the new direction Nintendo embarked upon in
recent Zelda games, encouraging creative problem solving in Breath of the Wild
and Tears of the Kingdom. Whatever the player wants to do, the game tries to
say yes, allowing for a high degree of chaos and unpredictability without ever
breaking — an impressive technical feat. Bananza wholly satisfies two divergent
but primal gamer desires: to feel clever, and to smash things. What more could
you want?</p><p class="MsoNormal">After a couple of months with my Switch 2, I've warmed to
the console. Although little about its design feels novel, the hardware boasts
dozens of small, thoughtful improvements that make it feel like a sleek,
grown-up gaming device, compared to which the original resembles a plastic toy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">These include more ergonomic Joy-Con controllers which snap
into place with satisfying magnets, and a larger screen which is better suited
to multiplayer sessions on the go. Then there’s the increased processing power
which means that games whose frame-rates struggled on the original Switch, such
as Fortnite or recent Pokémon and Zelda titles, now run as smooth as butter.
The Switch 2 makes most sense if you look at it like a phone upgrade — it’s
still a Switch, just better.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There are other decent games to play, too. Mario Kart World
does not move the needle significantly since the excellent Mario Kart 8, but
it’s still a great lark, with races now handling 24 players and a new knockout
mode where four players are eliminated each lap until only the best remain to
fight for gold. Super Mario Party Jamboree is another multiplayer offering with
new minigames utilising the console’s camera and mouse control capabilities,
hardware additions which have so far yet to prove themselves. A number of
quality third-party games also have Switch 2 releases, including Cyberpunk
2077, Hitman: World of Assassination and Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut, alongside
strong indies such as Deltarune and No Man's Sky.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The received wisdom with new console releases is to wait a
couple of years for a good library of games to be established before investing
in the hardware (the hardcore fans will buy on day one anyway — they already
made the Switch 2 the fastest-selling console in US history). Donkey Kong
Bananza is undoubtedly the first great game for the Switch 2, but it isn’t
quite enough to justify the purchase of a new console alone. Plus, Nintendo’s
upcoming release schedule looks murky. The only exciting game on the horizon is
sci-fi shooter Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, but the company might have something
else up its sleeve for the holiday season.</p><p class="MsoNormal">One quality that continues to set Nintendo apart from its
rivals is that it still puts a lot of stock in console-exclusive games. As
Microsoft and Sony move towards a hardware-agnostic position, allowing players
to access their games on a variety of devices, Nintendo still doggedly insists
that you can only play Nintendo games on a Nintendo console.</p><p class="MsoNormal">‘Bananza satisfies two primal gamer desires: to feel clever,
and to smash things’</p><p class="MsoNormal">For this reason alone, fans of the company’s unique approach
to game design will want to invest in a Switch 2 at some point.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Donkey Kong Bananza teaches us something else, too — that
Nintendo hasn't forgotten what it does best. It might have played it unusually
safe with the design of the new console, but this boldly strange game shows
that it plans to continue trying to surprise as well as delight, to maintain
its reputation as a company that always finds unexpected new ways to deliver
joy.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
