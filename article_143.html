yield on 30-year government bonds hit an all-time high of 3.21 per cent earlier
this month after a series of weak auctions — a sign, perhaps, that markets are
finally becoming concerned about the country’s enormous public debt. Number
two: according to Morgan Stanley, Japan’s budget deficit was almost completely
eliminated in the first quarter of this year, putting the public finances in
their best position for almost three decades.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Which of these is signal and which is noise? Is it a moment
for alarm or for optimism about Japan’s finances? A bad election result for the
ruling Liberal Democratic party this month, which raises the odds of
spendthrift, populist governance, seems like a good reason for markets to
worry. But the remarkable and little-appreciated transformation in Japan’s
economy since the pandemic makes the second fact more relevant: after decades
when it was trapped in a deflationary equilibrium, Japan is on its way to a new
regime. Managing the public finances of an elderly, low-growth country will
always be difficult, but Japan’s position is no longer obviously worse than
Italy, France or the UK, and its immediate fiscal trajectory looks quite a lot
healthier than the US. It is quite a turnaround.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To make sense of the shift, consider Japan’s situation
during the so-called “lost decades” after its bubble burst in 1990. The country
suffered from chronically weak demand. Corporates and households both sought to
save rather than spend. Prices were in deflation or thereabouts; interest rates
were stuck at zero. Wages were flat. To keep unemployment down and the economy
afloat, Japan’s government acted as the spender of last resort, stepping in
with regular stimulus packages, running persistent deficits that cumulated into
a large debt, all without ever doing enough to break free from the deflationary
trap. (China’s situation today is somewhat similar.)</p><p class="MsoNormal">The so-called Abenomics stimulus, following the election of
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2012, began to change this, but in the end it was
Covid and the associated global inflation that made the difference. Prices have
risen faster than the Bank of Japan’s 2 per cent goal for the past three years;
interest rates, at 0.5 per cent, are off the lower limit of zero; and wages are
rising. This return to nominal growth in wages and prices has led to an
immediate rise in revenues from income and consumption taxes, which is what has
brought the public finances back into balance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This transformation has been painful for the Japanese public
because it is unfinished. The inflation shock came from outside, rather than
within, and so wages have not kept up with prices, resulting in falling real
incomes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Expressed in terms of financial balances, a decline in the
government deficit has been offset by lower household savings, while the
corporate sector continues to run a surplus. The final, badly needed change is
to drive wages higher.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It makes sense, therefore, to seek a hot labour market and
raise interest rates only slowly, not least because the international
environment is ominous, with Japan badly exposed to competition from China and
tariffs in the US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nominal growth opens up a window during which it is possible
to bring down debt. Indeed, gross debt has already fallen from a peak of 258
per cent of GDP in 2020 to 235 per cent this year, according to the IMF. Price
rises have an almost instant effect on tax revenues, whereas it takes years for
existing debt to roll off and refinance at higher interest rates, so there is a
one-time benefit from moving to a regime with inflation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This window will not last forever. It would therefore be
unwise to squander it with tax giveaways or new spending pledges, other than,
perhaps, some short-term relief for households. While deflation continued,
stimulus made sense in order to escape it; now that inflation is back, fiscal
discipline must return as well. Politicians may find the changeover
uncomfortable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nor does the return of inflation solve the deeper problem of
growth in Japan’s economy. It never could, by itself.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Expanding a heavily regulated economy with an ageing,
declining population is an exceptionally hard challenge, and one Japan shares
with Europe. But healthy demand makes it easier to try. A tight labour market
with rising prices is a better environment in which to risk starting a new
business, to reform rigid employment protections or to borrow money in order to
invest.</p><p class="MsoNormal">What of the rise in 30-year bond yields? There is a
plausible technical explanation, which is that Japanese insurance companies
have already bought enough long-dated debt to match their liabilities, and the
government is issuing too much of it. An arguable fact is that it is executives
who are driving the increase in 10-year yields. They now stand at 1.57 per
cent, which does not imply an enormous risk premium for holding Japanese paper,
although nor does it encourage further borrowing.<br/>
Abe, the prime minister whose stimulus set the current changes in motion, was
gunned down in 2022 by a man with a grudge against a religious cult. To tackle
Japan’s endlessly rising debt by first ending deflation was always an explicit
goal of his policies. Politically, his stimulus was the easy part, and quite
naturally, nobody will appreciate it while incomes are still rising slower than
prices. The turnaround in Japan’s public finance is, nonetheless, a
vindication.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
