HEBA SALEH — CAIRO</p><p class="MsoNormal">Israel said it had started daily “tactical pauses” to
military activity in Gaza and would create “humanitarian corridors” throughout
the strip, an apparent reversal of its policy after months of severe aid
restrictions pushed the enclave to the brink of famine.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The shift was approved by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu’s government and announced by the Israel Defense Forces amid growing
international condemnation of what UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on
Saturday called the “appalling” humanitarian conditions inside Gaza.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The IDF said the halts to military activity, which began
yesterday, would happen daily from 10am to 8pm in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah and
the Al-Mawasi coastal area, places to which the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.1mn
people have been forcibly displaced and where Israeli ground troops are not
present.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In addition, the IDF said the humanitarian corridors would
be in place from 6am to 11pm every day to enable the “safe passage” of aid
convoys.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Tom Fletcher, the UN relief chief, welcomed the announcement
and said UN teams on the ground “will do all we can to reach as many starving
people as we can in this window”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The World Food Programme also welcomed Israel’s decision to
facilitate access to aid and said it had “enough food in or on its way to the
region to feed the entire population ... for almost three months”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Egyptian Red Crescent said yesterday that it had sent
more than 100 trucks into Gaza carrying more than 1,200 tonnes of flour and 450
tonnes of food packages.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However, one UN official said they were unclear on how long
the humanitarian corridors would be in place, while another said aid agencies
were in contact with the Israeli military for clarity on details of the new
arrangement.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Netanyahu, speaking at an air force base yesterday, said
Israel was allowing the entry of “minimal humanitarian supplies”, as it has
done “up until now”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The UN is creating excuses and lies against the state of
Israel,” he said. “There will be no more excuses. We will continue to act until
we achieve all of our war goals — until total victory.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Israeli air force began parachuting humanitarian
supplies into Gaza on Saturday night, while Jordan and the United Arab Emirates
also airdropped supplies into the enclave yesterday. UK officials said they
were sending additional military planners to Jordan to help co-ordinate the
airdrops.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Foreign air forces, including those of the UK, France,
Jordan and the UAE, have previously conducted airdrops over Gaza during the
conflict. But humanitarian organisations have criticised them as an inadequate
means of meeting the territory's needs, with one UN official describing them as
a “distraction and a smokescreen”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">David Lammy, the UK’s foreign secretary, said that while the
IDF’s announcement was “essential”, it “cannot alleviate the needs of those
desperately suffering in Gaza”. “We need a ceasefire that can end the war, for
hostages to be released and aid to enter Gaza by land unhindered,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Additional reporting by David Sheppard</p></body></html>
