five years after a slump in the iron ore price and cyclones in Western
Australia hit its biggest source of income.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Anglo-Australian miner yesterday said results for the
six months to June were “very resilient” given a 13 per cent drop in the
average iron ore price during the period. The decline hit group earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by about $2bn, chief financial
officer Peter Cunningham told the Financial Times.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Rio’s performance in copper, a key growth metal for the
mining industry, and aluminium made a key contribution. “We're getting so much
more contribution from aluminium and copper that you can see we’re less
dependent on the iron ore price,” said outgoing chief executive Jakob
Stausholm.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The results were the last to be presented by Stausholm, who
is being replaced next month by Simon Trott, head of iron ore. Trott is
expected to drive a group restructuring.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Stausholm said the miner had “solid foundations in place”,
having invested in growth markets, including lithium, during his tenure. The
outgoing chief was appointed five years ago after Rio destroyed a sacred
indigenous site at Juukan Gorge that led to the exit of its former chair and
chief executive. Stausholm yesterday called it “a horrible event” but said it
had led to a renewed emphasis on improving the culture at the company.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Rio's underlying ebitda dropped 5 per cent to $11.5bn in the
six months while underlying earnings fell 16 per cent to $4.8bn — the lowest
level since 2020. Rio has proposed a dividend of $1.48 a share, down from $1.77
a year ago and below analyst expectations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Stausholm said iron ore remained the “crown jewel” of its
operations but the company would seek ways to save costs. “The magic words at
Rio Tinto are continuous improvement,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">President Donald Trump's tariffs on copper, aluminium and
steel had created a turbulent environment for miners. Stausholm said they had
become a “huge topic” for the industry but that Rio had been able to navigate
their impact on its aluminium production in Canada while it should benefit from
tariffs on copper given that it had some production in the US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, trading house Glencore was hit by a 26 per cent
slide in copper production during the first half of the year and said it aimed
to make cost savings of about $1bn by the end of 2026. Glencore will report
earnings next week.</p></body></html>
