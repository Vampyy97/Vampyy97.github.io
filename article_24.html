Mental health is central to<br/>
the workplace. For a clear,<br/>
practical, compassionate<br/>
approach to the issue,<br/>
readers can do worse than<br/>
this book. Bhatti and<br/>
Roulet focus on solutions,<br/>
introducing "wellbeing<br/>
intelligence" (WBQ), a<br/>
learnable skillset for<br/>
identifying and improving<br/>
mental health at work.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The authors, a<br/>
psychologist and business<br/>
school professor, focus on<br/>
three concentric "circles":<br/>
self, colleagues and wider<br/>
organisation. They draw<br/>
on research and personal<br/>
experience to show how<br/>
wellbeing issues manifest<br/>
and how managers and<br/>
employees can respond<br/>
with care and skill.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Case studies bring<br/>
realities to life and are<br/>
paired with practical tools,<br/>
including the ARC model<br/>
(Acknowledge, Respond,<br/>
Change), a simple yet<br/>
effective framework for<br/>
sensitive conversations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The book refuses to<br/>
settle for slogans, arguing<br/>
that mental health must<br/>
become embedded in<br/>
culture and strategy. If<br/>
there is a limitation, it is<br/>
the optimistic tone on<br/>
systemic change. But this<br/>
stands out as a timely<br/>
guide equipping readers<br/>
with insight and tools to<br/>
make the workplace more<br/>
human.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Leo Cremonezi</i></p></body></html>
