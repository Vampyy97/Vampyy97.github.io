latest quarter as the costs of a turnaround effort come into sharper view.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The world’s biggest coffee house chain reported net income
plunged 47 per cent to $558mn in the three months to the end of June, worse
than expectations for a 30 per cent year-on-year decline.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Starbucks has been hiring more baristas and employing new
hospitality standards to entice customers back into stores after more than a
year of falling sales.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Green Apron Service model rolling out across 11,000
North American stores next month will also feature an algorithm meant to
deliver drinks to café and drive-through customers in less than four minutes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Chief executive Brian Niccol called it “Starbucks’ biggest
investment ever in operating standards and customer service” in a call with
analysts on Tuesday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The investments have added costs. Cathy Smith, chief
financial officer, said Starbucks would spend more than $500mn on additional
wages in the company's US stores in the next year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Starbucks said its operating profit margin fell 6.8
percentage points year on year to 9.9 per cent in the quarter to June, pushed
in part by labour costs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Its shares were down more than 8 per cent in early trading
yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">After Niccol joined Starbucks last year, he said that he did
not intend to raise prices for the rest of fiscal year, which ends in
September. Starbucks’ relatively high prices have put off customers already
stretched by inflation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday, Niccol said that while he was reluctant to raise
prices “there are times where it makes sense... we’re going to do it in the
least amount of pricing necessary.”</p></body></html>
