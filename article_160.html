tariffs as retro styles recover bounce</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="647" src="FT_files/image076.png" width="551"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">By Florian Muller — Frankfurt</p><p class="MsoNormal">Adidas has warned that US tariffs will increase its costs by
up to €200mn in the second half of the year, even as surging demand for its
retro trainers, such as the Samba and Gazelle, continues to power growth at
Germany's largest sportswear group.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Chief executive Bjorn Gulden said yesterday that the tariffs
had already cost the company “double-digit euro millions” in the second
quarter, and warned the measures could further hurt consumer demand if they
triggered “major inflation”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The levies stem from US import duties on some of Adidas’s
manufacturing hubs. US tariffs for Vietnam, where Adidas makes 30 per cent of
its goods for the US market, rose 20 percentage points. Tariffs for Indonesia,
which makes 23 per cent of US supply, rose 19 percentage points.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Gulden said the company would not alter prices in the US
until it knew US President Donald Trump’s final tariff rates, which are
expected to be announced next month. He said Adidas would rather boost prices
for new products as they were “easier to increase than products which already
exist”, and would not change them on popular items for “as long as we can”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Gulden said that under normal circumstances Adidas would
have raised its full-year guidance after a strong start to the year. But “we
feel the volatility and uncertainty in the world does not make this prudent”,
he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Shares were 10.7 per cent lower yesterday and down more than
a fifth over the past year. Investors are gauging if the brand can continue
closing the gap with US rival Nike after the success of retro trainers more
than offset the absence of revenues from the defunct Yeezy line with rapper Ye.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Citi analysts highlighted that this was the first quarter
without a pre-release of stronger than expected results in more than 18 months.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Adidas is maintaining its forecast of high single-digit
percentage growth in currency-neutral revenues for the full year and an
operating profit between €1.7bn and €1.8bn — below the €2.1bn expected by
analysts.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the second quarter, the group increased net sales by 2.2
per cent year on year to nearly €6bn, despite negative currency effects from a
weak renminbi and dollar reducing revenues by €300mn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Revenues climbed across all regions and product categories,
led by a 17 per cent jump in clothing sales and continued momentum in its retro
lines.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In Europe, revenues rose just 4 per cent, slower than
analysts expected.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sales picked up again in July, with Gulden expecting growth
to return to double digits in the coming quarters.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Operating profit surged 57.7 per cent to €546mn in the
second quarter.</p></body></html>
