<img border="0" height="392" src="FT_files/image091.jpg" width="601"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">Of all Shakespeare’s plays, <i>The Winter’s Tale</i> owes
most to folklore and myth. Like the Greek goddess Persephone, the lost girl
Perdita is torn from her mother’s arms as winter descends, only to return in
fertile summer. In Shakespeare’s version, this reunion takes not six months but
16 years, and the disruptive force is not an unwanted husband but a violent
father.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yaël Farber’s production is attuned to these mythic
underpinnings, bringing a moody symbolism familiar from her recent Almeida
Theatre productions of <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>King Lear</i>. But
against its implausible fairytale twists, any <i>Winter’s Tale</i> depends
on the psychological credibility of King Leontes’ first-act breakdown, as
uncontrollable sexual jealousy leads him to denounce his blameless wife
Hermione and reject their newborn daughter. In Bertie Carvel, Farber has a star
with the necessary weighty realism.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Pathetic and helpless in his imagined cuckoldry, this
Leontes giggles like a child at his own cleverness, unreachable within the
conspiracies he has woven. Machismo lets him reclaim control. Perhaps it masks
other insecurities. Leontes imagines ally King Polixenes taking his place in
his bed: but it is only of his friend’s body that he dreams; Madeline Appiah’s
Hermione is nowhere in sight. Earlier we have watched these men lovingly
wrestle skin to skin, like graceful dancers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some may find Farber’s classical allusions too opaque, or
miss the raucous comedy that other directors inject into the scenes of
Perdita’s rural adolescence, after she has been adopted by bumpkins. But Farber
never loses the thread of a narrative that feels all too contemporary —
Carvel’s Leontes would surely be an admirer of Andrew Tate — and it leads to an
unforgettable tableau of family rupture and reconciliation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Farber fuses the role of the hustler Autolycus with the
allegorical figure of Father Time, the play’s original narrator. It suits a
production that favours menace over joviality. Circling the stage, Trevor Fox
is a sardonic presence, his Victorian black garb and shovel making him more
gravedigger than jester, although he quotes Guy Lombardo lyrics alongside
chunks of Brecht. A fiddle player, cellist and accordionist fly in and out like
refugees from a Chagall painting.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Soutra Gilmour’s designs reflect the play’s concern with
climatic shifts. A sphere depicting planet Earth hovers over the stage as we
take our seats, its surface later transforming into icy moons and blazing suns.
Perdita’s coming of age is not so much a festival of fertility as of fire,
danced under an angry red planet.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Polixenes disrupts this feast, furious to discover his own
son Prince Florizel secretly courting the humbly reared Perdita. John Light as
Polixenes carries a coil of barely contained threat, reminding us that
misogynistic violence is not confined to Leontes’ court.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This warfare between men and women is fundamental to
Farber’s vision of the play. Where lone men rupture the social fabric, women
heal it. Both Hermione and Perdita are surrounded by a protective sisterhood of
the same female attendants, choreographed like swans.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The strongest force of all is Aïcha Kossoko as Paulina, the
woman who verbally cudgels Leontes into penance. An outsider in this court, as
indicated by her French West African accent, she has never seemed more
implacable and battle-scarred. Farber’s decision to change Perdita’s adoptive
father to a mother underlines this approach. Polixenes, in an adapted line,
calls her a “witch”. The transcendent scene of reconciliation, however worth
the trip alone, is pure Shakespeare.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To August 30, rsc.org.uk</p></body></html>
