after year-long Silent Crow cyber attack</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Courtney Weaver — Berlin</i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img height="617" src="FT_files/image029.jpg" width="601"/></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Russian state-owned airline Aeroflot was forced to cancel
dozens of flights yesterday, after a hacking group claimed credit for a
devastating year-long cyber attack.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The outage suffered by the country’s largest carrier is the
latest in a series of cyber attacks against state-owned Russian enterprises
this year, and one of several claimed by a new hacker group called Silent Crow.</p><p class="MsoNormal">By late morning yesterday, 49 flights had been cancelled and
dozens more delayed, according to Aeroflot. The airline, which did not
immediately confirm details of the hack, said it was working to “restore all
services to normal as quickly as possible.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">It is not known whether Silent Crow, which posts messages in
Russian and created a Telegram account only last December, is linked to a
foreign state. The group said yesterday that it had been inside Aeroflot’s IT
system for a year, in an attack orchestrated with Cyber Partisans, a group of
Belarusian hackers that operates outside its home country.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Silent Crow said it had been able to “obtain and download”
Aeroflot’s “entire array of flight history databases,” destroy 7,000 servers,
and steal 20 terabytes of data, including surveillance systems files and
recordings of executives’ conversations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Russia's prosecutor-general’s office confirmed the airline
hack and said it had opened a criminal investigation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Russia has experienced an increase in cyber attacks since
the beginning of its full-scale war in Ukraine, said Vyacheslav Kirillov, an
expert at cyber security group Kaspersky. Hackers were increasingly targeting
financial organisations, the public sector, telecom providers and the media, he
said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The first attack claimed by Silent Crow was against
Rosreestr, the government agency managing property and land records.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Last week, Ukrainian news outlets reported that Ukrainian
hackers were behind a cyber attack on Gazprom that caused significant
disruptions and destroyed vast amounts of data.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Other Russian businesses hit by cyber attacks this year
include state rail company Russian Railways, the Moscow metro system and
Russian internet provider ASVT.</p><p class="MsoNormal">President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said
reports of the Aeroflot attack were “alarming.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Russia's aviation sector has become increasingly stymied by
Ukrainian drone attacks — one of Kyiv’s few tools for making the three-year war
hit home for middle-class Russians. Russian airlines were forced to cancel 485
flights in early July during a particularly bad period for drone strikes.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
