has damaged trust</p><p class="MsoNormal">For much of Ukraine’s post-Soviet history, alongside
Russia’s attempts to re-establish its influence, corruption has been a cancer
gnawing at the country’s institutions. So even in the midst of war with its
neighbour, when Volodymyr Zelenskyy rushed through a law last week eliminating
the independence of two anti-corruption bodies, thousands of Ukrainians took to
the streets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The president quickly appeared to understand the scale of
his blunder and backtracked; the country’s parliament will vote this week on a
law reversing the changes. But the damage will not be quickly undone; many
Ukrainians see the episode as symbolic of the government’s authoritarian
leanings, or at least excessive centralisation of power.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Zelenskyy has rightly been lauded for his inspirational
leadership. Mobilising a country to repel a foreign invader clearly involves
exceptional measures. Ukrainians have accepted martial law, the cancellation of
elections and in effect a suspension of politics as usual.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But the law fast-tracked through parliament and signed by
the president last Tuesday touched a nerve. It granted his office greater
control over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and Specialised
Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office, both set up in the wake of the 2014 Maidan
protests that toppled pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych. Those
demonstrations were not just against Kremlin interference but also a model of
kleptocratic governance seen as Russian — in contrast to “European” rule-of-law
principles.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ukraine’s president justified the move against Nabu and Sapo
by suggesting they had been penetrated by pro-Russian interests. But he offered
no evidence. Many in Ukrainian civil society — which has once again displayed
its vibrancy — suspect the law was motivated by the fact that corruption probes
have closed in on figures close to the presidency.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Citizens have accepted martial law, the cancellation of
elections and ineffective suspension of politics as usual.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As well as inflaming domestic opinion, the law jeopardised
Ukraine’s EU accession process and potentially financial support from the EU
and the IMF on which Kyiv is entirely dependent, and which have insisted on the
independence of the anti-graft bodies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Zelenskyy quickly reversed course, saying he would submit a
new bill to parliament that would guarantee the agencies’ autonomy. But the
fact that the presidential administration had initially gone ahead with the law
— despite pleadings not to from France’s President Emmanuel Macron and European
Council President Antonio Costa — points to what even some of the country’s
supporters call a worsening bunker mentality. They suggest the leadership
circle has gone beyond necessary wartime consolidation of control and used its
powers to silence dissenting voices and curb rival power centres.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There is no suggestion of personal wrongdoing by the
president — and he is not, as President Donald Trump claimed in February, a
“dictator”. But to begin to restore trust, it is vital that the law protecting
the anti-graft bodies is swiftly passed, given concerns that some lawmakers may
drag their feet.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Foreign partners such as the EU have arguably been too
tolerant of the presidential circle’s weakening of vital checks and balances.
They should take a firmer stance, and make clear that while the EU rightly
wants to welcome Ukraine as a member, meeting the requirements to join will
require a fundamental change of culture of the ruling class.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Most importantly, Zelenskyy will need to repair the damage
with his own people. Ukrainians have shown extraordinary courage in the past
three years. They need to be sure they are fighting not just for an independent
Ukraine, but one that will be governed by democracy and the rule of law.</p></body></html>
