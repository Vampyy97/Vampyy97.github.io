evade online safety law</h2><p class="MsoNormal">TIM BRADSHAW — LONDON</p><p class="MsoNormal">British internet users have rushed to access services that
disguise a user’s online location after new age verification rules came into
force.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Thousands of sites offering adult content, as well as
popular social media apps including X, Reddit and TikTok, have introduced “age
assurance” controls for UK users since Friday to comply with the Online Safety
Act.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The age checks are designed to prevent children under 18
from accessing sites that carry pornography as well as other harmful material
that relates to self-harm, eating disorders or suicide.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But to evade the new rules, a growing number of people are
turning to tools more often used by citizens in authoritarian regimes to get
around internet censorship.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Apps offering virtual private networks — which route a
smartphone or PC’s internet traffic through another country, bypassing local
network providers — made up half of the top 10 most popular free apps on the
UK’s App Store for iOS this weekend, according to Apple’s rankings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Proton VPN leapfrogged ChatGPT to become the top free app in
the UK, according to Apple’s daily App Store charts, with similar services from
developers Super Unlimited and Nord Security also rising over the weekend.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Proton said it had experienced a more than 1,800 per cent
increase in daily sign-ups from UK-based users. Nord said there had been a
1,000 per cent increase in UK purchases of VPN subscriptions.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We would normally associate these large spikes in sign-ups
with major civil unrest,” Proton said. “This clearly shows that adults are
concerned about the impact universal age verification laws will have on their
privacy.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The UK is one of the first democratic countries to impose
such strict content controls on tech companies, making it a test case that will
be monitored around the world. Several US states and Australia have also sought
to impose age-based restrictions for online services.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Platforms in breach of the rules face penalties of up to
£18mn or 10 per cent of global turnover, whichever is greater.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Act — which was passed under the previous Conservative
government in 2023 — has also become a potential flashpoint with the US. Trump
administration officials oppose anything they see as a restriction on freedom
of speech.</p></body></html>
