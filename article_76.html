force you to mash buttons to keep pedalling, my keyboard thanks you. The
cycling game from California-based developer Messhof avoids the trope that
saw <i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i> ruin several of my
PlayStation 2 controllers — here you just hold down the space bar while instead
focusing on gear shifts, staying in the slipstream and trying very hard not to
hit traffic.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Wheel World</i> is a racing game, albeit one
disguised in the cel-shaded whimsy of an indie adventure. The island of
Tramonto is home to all manner of motley challengers — pirates, chefs, robots,
farmers — keen to race you. Winning, beating times or acquiring letters
scattered across the racetracks in the style of old skateboarding games will
increase your reputation, unlocking more of the world.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To what end? That’s a little harder to explain. You play
Kat, a blue-haired woman with eyes like fried eggs and no obvious back-story
beyond inexplicable cycling prowess. You awake one day in a grove of
rust-coloured trees, a big green monolith looming in the distance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Inside you meet Skully, an immortal bike demon with cranial
form and an unimaginative name. Skully needs your help to ride the Chain of
Life, a celestial slipstream linking your world and the Moon.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Why you (and why at all) is not obviously clear, beyond the
fact that Skully couldn't find anyone else napping in a glade. But to help him,
you'll need to recover the various legendary bike parts — saddle, frame,
handlebars etc — that will grant you access to the Chain of Life.</p><p class="MsoNormal">These were pilfered by renowned cyclists across Tramonto,
whom you'll have to race to win them back, all the while tricking out your
rusty old bike with upgrades.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The bike has four stats: power, aero, handling and grip.
Sourced from neat yellow boxes that wash ashore like the FedEx packages in Cast
Away, or purchased using the currency imposed by a cycling mega-corporation, an
array of parts will increase or decrease these stats; it’s up to you to balance
or imbalance them in your favour.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The racing itself is surprisingly satisfying, combining the
constant jostling and trash-talking of your opponents with the restful rhythms
of the sport. It helps that the island of Tramonto is a terribly picturesque
place, punctuated by bicycle vendors selling their wares from the pavements and
makeshift ramps to launch you over the vineyards.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It is not a bug-free experience — particularly when the game
insists that Kat jump back on her bike as soon as any dialogue ends, no matter
how hemmed in she is by obstacles. And there are the usual racing-game
frustrations that your AI opponents might not be working within the same laws
of physics that you are. But there is some neat attention to detail, too: the
vista from the main menu gliding neatly down to where you last left off, or the
shimmering soundtrack by indie record label Italians Do It Better.</p><p class="MsoNormal">You wouldn't necessarily judge a Need for Speed or Burnout
game for its lack of plot. But <i>Wheel World</i>, with its sparky
dialogue and anti-corporate subtext, clearly aspires to something deeper. It is
quirky, idiosyncratic and fun, but that’s about as far as it goes. You may be
left feeling that it needs something else to drive it forward — something stronger
than just pedals.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
