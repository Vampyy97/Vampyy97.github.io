tsunami alarms and evacuations from Japan to the US and a state of emergency in
some areas.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of
Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula, with the epicentre 120 km from the city of
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, according to the US Geological Survey. Dozens of
aftershocks included one of 6.9 magnitude.</p><p class="MsoNormal">More than 1.9 million people were instructed to evacuate to
higher ground in Japan, while Hawaii and the US west coast were braced for high
waves, though hours after the quake many tsunami warnings were downgraded and
there were no reports of fatalities.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The earthquake was among the strongest ever recorded and the
biggest since the 9.1-magnitude Tohoku quake in 2011, which triggered a massive
tsunami that devastated large parts of Japan’s north-east coast and the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lisa McNeill, professor of tectonics at the University of
Southampton in the UK, said a number of factors affected the size of tsunamis,
including the “local shapes of the seafloor near the coast and the morphology
of the land where it strikes”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In Russia, a state of emergency was declared in
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Yelizovsky district, which was hit by a tsunami
of three to four metres, and the Severo-Kurilsky district in the northern Kuril
Islands, where a port was flooded and about 2,700 people were evacuated. There
was minimal impact elsewhere.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In Japan, the country’s meteorological agency issued a
tsunami warning for waves of up to three metres along wide stretches of the
east coast. In 2011, the country was battered by waves that reached up to 40
metres. Yesterday, workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant were
evacuated, while across Japan hundreds of stores were closed and several
factories shut.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The meteorological agency warned: “Tsunamis can strike
repeatedly over a long period of time. Waves that come after the first one can
be even larger, so please remain evacuated until warnings and advisories are
officially lifted.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the US, the National Weather Service issued tsunami
warnings for Alaska’s western archipelago, Hawaii and part of California. Most
were later downgraded to advisories, though the higher warning level remained
in place for part of northern California.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Officials in Hawaii told residents to return home shortly
before 11 pm. On Tuesday night, US President Donald Trump wrote on social
media: “STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Indonesia issued a tsunami warning for 10 eastern cities,
including the provinces of Papua and North Maluku.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Taiwan issued a warning, saying waves could reach up to a
metre. China also issued warnings for Shanghai and the coastal Zhejiang
province for 30-40 cm waves, but later withdrew them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Additional reporting by Kathrin Hille in Taipei, Diana
