industry</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Editorial Board</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">Volkswagen, the German automotive giant, has long stood as a
symbol of industrial might and engineering prowess. But recent developments
underscore the mounting difficulties faced by European manufacturing in the age
of global competition, digital transformation and the green transition.</p><p class="MsoNormal">VW’s recent announcement that it would scale back production
of its electric vehicles and suspend a number of battery projects in Europe is
telling. While demand for EVs is growing, it is not doing so fast enough to
meet the group’s original projections. Chinese rivals, meanwhile, are flooding
global markets with cheaper, technologically advanced electric models, backed
by state subsidies and years of strategic planning.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This exposes a broader issue: Europe’s industrial base is
being squeezed from all sides. On the one hand, it must invest massively in new
technologies — from EVs to green steel — to meet environmental goals and remain
competitive. On the other, it faces higher energy prices, regulatory burdens
and sluggish domestic demand.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US has responded to similar challenges with the
Inflation Reduction Act, a massive programme of subsidies and tax breaks aimed
at revitalising American manufacturing. China, as noted, is using state
capitalism to back national champions. Europe, however, remains divided on how
far it should go in offering state support or loosening fiscal rules.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Volkswagen’s predicament illustrates the limits of relying
solely on market forces to drive transformation. While competition is vital, it
needs to be complemented by targeted public investment, clear industrial
strategy and a willingness to support companies through periods of structural
change.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Europe’s policymakers must face these realities head on.
That means streamlining regulation, investing in infrastructure, improving
access to finance for green technologies, and ensuring that the energy
transition does not price industry out of global markets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">VW’s difficulties should be a wake-up call. If even its
scale and resources are insufficient to navigate the current industrial
landscape, smaller players will face even greater hurdles. European industry
can still compete globally — but only if it is given the tools and environment
to adapt.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
