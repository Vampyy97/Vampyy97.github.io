warn</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><i>President’s $750bn target dismissed • US energy rally
fades as reality bites</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">JAMIE SMYTH AND MARTHA MUIR — NEW YORK<br/>
KRISTINA SHEVORY — AUSTIN</p><p class="MsoNormal">Brussels’ vow to buy $750bn of American energy as part of a
US-EU trade deal will be impossible to meet and is based on “pie in the sky”
numbers, experts have warned, even as producers said that it could boost sales.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal, announced by President Donald Trump and European
Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, requires EU companies to
buy $250bn worth of US oil, natural gas and nuclear technologies for each of
the next three years.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Analysts were puzzled by a target that would involve
decisions by shareholder-owned companies in a continent that is also
endeavouring to decarbonise its economy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Even if Europe did want to increase its imports, I don’t
know the mechanism by which the EU goes to these companies and tells them to
buy more US energy,” said Matt Smith at energy consultancy Kpler.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The numbers were “pie in the sky,” he added. “Companies are
beholden to their shareholders and have a duty to buy the cheapest feedstock.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Energy was at the heart of a trade deal that Trump claimed
was one of the most significant ever. The US president has touted an era of
American “energy dominance” based on “unleashing” fossil fuel output, although
drilling in the prolific shale oil and gas sector has slowed since he returned
to the White House.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Shares in US energy companies rose on news of the EU deal,
which could buoy liquefied natural gas and oil exporters that have already
benefited from Europe's efforts to cut Russian energy imports. But the rally
faded as the reality of the plan sank in.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Last year, the EU imported more than $435.7bn worth of
energy — but US fossil fuel supplies to the bloc accounted for just $75bn.
Brussels plans to phase out purchases of Russian gas altogether by 2028,
including LNG, which would open another gap for US exporters.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But analysts say that the $250bn target would be impossible
to meet while ensuring Europe’s — and Trump’s — desire for cheap, secure energy
supplies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“This would require Europe to import a lot more volumes of
gas and oil from the US, diverting away from other suppliers, while assuming
oil and gas prices would remain high or even increase to reach the $250bn
target,” said Anne-Sophie Corbeau, an energy analyst at Columbia University’s
Center on Global Energy Policy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We want to reduce energy bills and President Trump wants to
reduce oil prices — so this agreement makes no sense.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">US producers were more enthusiastic about the deal, saying
that it would help European companies that import energy to sign more US supply
deals.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The American Petroleum Institute, Big Oil’s powerful
Washington lobby group, said the agreement would “solidify America’s role” as a
critical supplier to Europe. LNG executives said it could help developers
secure more financing to build a new wave of liquefaction plants in the Gulf of
Mexico — the heart of the US's bustling gas-export industry.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“This is a catalyst that certainly supports continued
offtake contracting,” said Ben Dell, chair of Commonwealth LNG, referring to
long-term purchase agreements.</p></body></html>
