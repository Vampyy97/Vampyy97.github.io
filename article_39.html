to the US (“The return of ‘tariff man’: the week Donald Trump revived the
global trade war”, Report, FT.com, July 11) should not be interpreted as a
victory by the political elite in Phnom Penh, but as a wake-up call for the Hun
regime to invest and put Cambodia on a new economic trajectory.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The regime has had three months to negotiate a deal that
would protect Cambodian citizens from the effects of these proposed levies, and
to introduce reforms that will better shield the country from future economic
shocks. On both counts it has failed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I call on the regime to firstly prioritise safeguarding
low-income borrowers and at-risk workers in rural, small and medium-sized
enterprises. Second it must modernise the country’s education system, so we
have a workforce fit for the future; and, last, it must tear down social
barriers, so that women have the same opportunities as men to take up
leadership roles in the Cambodian economy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Reforms that build greater resilience in the Cambodian
economy, while promoting long-term development and democratic decision-making,
are now essential. If the regime ignores this reality, and the growing demands
of its citizens, Cambodia will remain vulnerable to the actions of more
powerful nations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Mu Sochua<br/>
