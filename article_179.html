Biden-era policy</h2><p class="MsoNormal">The US Treasury will issue more short-term debt to help fund
its widening budget deficit, a continuation of a Biden-era policy that Treasury
secretary Scott Bessent had previously disavowed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Treasury department said yesterday that it would keep
the size of its auctions of longer-dated bonds steady over the next “several
quarters.” This suggests a vast increase in issuance of shorter-term debt —
Treasury bills that mature in anything between a week and a year — to meet the
$1tn that the department needs this quarter to keep the government running.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Despite disavowing it before he took office, Bessent has
adopted the debt management strategy of his predecessor, Janet Yellen.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Skewing its debt issuance to more shorter-dated bonds allows
the US government to step up its borrowing without sending yields on
longer-dated bonds higher. The yields — which move inversely to prices — of
longer-dated bonds determine interest rates across the economy from the
government’s borrowing costs to mortgage rates.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The department said on Monday that it would raise $1tn in
the three months to September, up sharply from the $554bn it estimated for the
April to June quarter. The increase is primarily due to technical needs because
of the debt limit.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Over the past two decades, increasing auction sizes have
reflected the US government’s expansion of borrowing to fund tax cuts and
spending programmes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The current debt strategy is somewhat risky because of the
quick turnover of short-term debt. Each time that such debt matures — at least
once a year — it must be replaced by new debt issued at current interest rates.
If rates were to increase, the Treasury department’s debt burden would grow.</p><p class="MsoNormal">When Yellen began relying more on short-term debt to plug
the government’s financing needs, Stephen Miran — now head of President Donald
Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers — and economist Nouriel Roubini wrote an
academic paper on the practice, calling it “activist Treasury issuance,” which
they said was tantamount to “stealth quantitative easing.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">They argued that, by relying on shorter-term debt, the
government was artificially depressing longer-term rates and that the Treasury
department was thereby enacting monetary policy, which is traditionally the
role of the US Federal Reserve.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
