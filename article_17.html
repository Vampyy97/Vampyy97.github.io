NEW YORK</p><p class="MsoNormal">The number of "boomerang CEOs" — corporate bosses
who have been brought back for a second stint in the top job — is at a 10-year
high in the US as boards of directors increasingly reach back to the past to
fill gaps in their succession plans.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A burst of reappointments in the past nine months, after a
record year for boomerang hiring in 2023, means that 22 companies in the
S&amp;P 1500 are now run by chief executives who have returned to the role,
according to recruitment consultancy Spencer Stuart.</p><p class="MsoNormal">They range from household names such as Disney, where Bob
Iger stepped back in to replace his successor as chief executive in 2022, and
Dell Technologies, where founder Michael Dell is on a second stint in charge,
to smaller companies in semiconductors, retail and homebuilding.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the latest example this month, Microchip Technology
announced that Steve Sanghi, who ran the company for 30 years until 2021 and
returned last year as interim chief executive, would keep the top job on a
permanent basis.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Boards have gotten better and more systematic at
succession planning," said Jim Citrin, head of Spencer Stuart's CEO
practice, "and the key question is, what are all the options? Boomerang
CEOs have tended to be pretty high-profile so now, as part of every succession
planning conversation, it's one of the options."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Spencer Stuart data suggests boomerang CEOs typically fail
to match the shareholder returns of their first term during their second
innings. After outperforming the market by 5.5 per cent a year on average
during their first stint, they underperform by 7.4 per cent during their
second, according to its analysis of 86 boomerang CEOs in the S&amp;P 1500
since 2000.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The number of boomerang CEOs remains relatively small
overall but the increase has raised questions among investors who assume that
management is grooming the next generation of potential leaders and boards of
directors are casting the net widely for talent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"It's probably easier and also in some cases prudent to
go to a trusted individual but that doesn't lessen the potential concern of
lack of succession planning for the longer term," said Bob McCormick,
executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Boomerang CEOs are often founders or longtime bosses who are
brought back to put a company on an even keel during a period of turmoil.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In May, for example, UnitedHealth, the medical insurance
group, reappointed Stephen Hemsley to replace Sir Andrew Witty after the
company slashed profit forecasts and came under regulatory scrutiny.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Jun Frank, head of governance and compensation advisory for
ISS-Corporate, said: "Asking someone to come back is not a sign of bad
governance per se, but it does speak to challenges for the company and may
indicate potential trouble at the board level."</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Experts hired for smarter large language models</p></body></html>
