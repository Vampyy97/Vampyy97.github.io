Warshaw. London’s pre-eminent deal bankers yesterday announced that their
eponymous firm, Robey Warshaw, would be acquired by the New York-based Evercore
for a shade under $200mn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Robey Warshaw has just five partners, but as a “kiosk” —
smaller than a boutique — it has represented some of Europe’s biggest
companies, including BP and AstraZeneca, in multibillion-dollar situations. For
the tiny firm, that has meant annual revenue that sometimes exceeded £80mn
since its founding in 2013.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Larger banks such as Evercore will often acquire small teams
of dealmakers to fill a hole in the roster. Those arrangements tend to come
with some guaranteed pay for a finite number of years. Robey Warshaw has,
however, pulled off a rarer trick: it is getting Evercore to pay for the full
enterprise value of the firm — the capitalised stream of the profits from
future Robey Warshaw deal fees.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Robey Warshaw team will still also separately get paid
their annual salaries and bonuses for being employees. For Evercore, those are
the rich terms — it is paying twice, in effect — of its effort to conquer
European M&amp;A.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Through aggressive poaching for the past two decades,
Evercore has efficiently built an investment banking advisory business that
usually ranks third or fourth in annual fees, at about $2.5bn. That puts it in
the league of the much vaster Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. With
about 150 senior bankers, that is equivalent to more than $15mn per head and
ranks at the top of the sector.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Often banking hires do not pan out but Evercore is the rare
firm that has consistently backed the correct horses at favourable odds. Since
the start of 2009, Evercore’s share price has gone from $30 to $300 — its
current market capitalisation today is more than $12bn — a performance that far
exceeds the growth in the pool of deal fees.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet the firm remains disproportionately US-focused and, with
less white space remaining in North America, the UK and France have become
central to maintaining its growth trajectory. Robey Warshaw never tried to
build such a multibillion-dollar business by adding scores of bankers every
year. Instead, its partnership tier remained skinny, focused on a handful of
large-cap clients. That meant it could pay most of its substantial profits
annually to staff without having to worry about meeting margin and cost of
capital requirements of third-party shareholders.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The success of this “stick to its knitting” strategy
depended on its few stars, year after year, bagging elephants. The prize for
succeeding is not only $200mn, but also the additional future pay the Robey
Warshaw team is going to rake in.</p></body></html>
