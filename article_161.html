pay rule</h2><p class="MsoNormal">By Nic Fildes</p><p class="MsoNormal">Australia’s long-standing “two-strikes” rule to curb
executive pay came under the spotlight last week when shareholders lodged a
protest vote against the remuneration of those who work at what has become
known as the “millionaires’ factory”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Macquarie, the Sydney-based bank and asset manager, has for
decades doled out huge sums to its top executives as a reward for delivering
strong returns. The sharing of the bank’s profit pool for workers is regarded
as fundamental to its success in generating value for Australian shareholders
and pension funds that provide its capital.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But even Macquarie has found that it is not immune to the
growing tide of shareholder wrath in Australia.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The country’s unique “strike” system — once seen as a
pioneering method that other markets would copy — is intended to add a sense of
peril to annual meeting season. A strike occurs when more than 25 per cent of
shareholders vote against a company’s pay proposal at an AGM. Although it is a
nonbinding vote, a second strike in the following year triggers a potential
vote to dissolve the board — known as a “spill” — meaning all directors, except
the chief executive, need to stand for re-election.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Introduced in 2011 and designed to give shareholders a
mechanism to protest about excessive pay awards, the strike option has also
handed shareholders a blunt weapon to tackle issues beyond remuneration.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For Macquarie, a growing list of compliance allegations —
including legal action from Australia’s market regulator accusing it of
misreporting historic short trade data, a settlement with US regulators
following charges of inflated asset valuations and a fine by the UK financial
watchdog over fictitious trades — acted as a catalyst for a strike.
Shareholders complained there had been only “paltry” cuts to pay in response.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Macquarie’s board stepped up efforts to soothe those
concerns and its chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake, who earned A$24mn last
year, took the unusual step of calling some shareholders to discuss their
concerns to gauge whether the issue with the profit pool was fundamental or
fleeting.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Strikes have become a more regular feature of AGM season in
Australia. Georgeson, the shareholder engagement consultancy, said just over 10
per cent of companies in the S&amp;P/ASX 300 index have suffered a strike this
year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet, in practice, the threat to boards is limited even when
strikes have recurred. Georgeson research showed there was a rise in second
strikes in 2024 and yet no spill votes have been cast against boards even for
companies enduring their fourth straight rebuke.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Georgeson points out that mainstream institutional
investors, such as superannuation funds and index investors, are averse to
forcing a board spill, no matter how strong their objections to a company’s
remuneration structure, executive conduct or performance may be. And while
critics of the two-strike rule often cite concerns that the rule could be
harnessed by activists to take over the boards of companies, those fears have
not been borne out.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The lack of boardroom dissolutions could suggest that the
two strikes rule is an idle threat that most companies can ignore. Yet it could
also indicate that the threat of reputational damage spurs a board to pull its
socks up and avoid a second strike.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Qantas, the airline, was hit with a near-83 per cent strike
in 2023 as investors joined its customers and unionised staff in revolt. The
company shook up its board and its executive team, clawed back bonuses and
published a damning report into its culture in the year that followed. Its
remuneration policy passed by a 86 per cent majority in 2024 and the company’s
shares hit record highs this year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Elizabeth Sheedy, an academic at Macquarie University (which
shares a historic name with the bank but is otherwise unconnected), said the
two-strike rule has transformed Australia’s capital markets into an “engagement
paradise”, fostering more access for investors and making companies more
focused on long-term value creation and responsive on environmental, social and
governance matters.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“It generates a lot of embarrassment and companies have to
take evasive action,” she said of boards facing the prospect of a second
strike.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In 2026, the prospect of boardroom blood being spilled at
Macquarie looks remote based on the record of the two-strike rule. But the
pressure is building on the board to act to avoid more embarrassment.</p></body></html>
