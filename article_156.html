Advisory firm boasts key UK bankers</p><p class="MsoNormal">By Ivan Levingston — Montreal<br/>
Arash Massoudi — London</p><p class="MsoNormal">Evercore has agreed to buy elite UK advisory firm Robey
Warshaw for $196mn, as the US investment bank steps up its challenge to the
likes of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase in Europe with the
addition of some of London’s best known dealmakers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">New York-based Evercore will pay the equivalent of $40mn for
each of Robey Warshaw’s five partners, which include former UK chancellor
George Osborne, as it strengthens its presence in the second-largest market
after the US for investment banking fees.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal will transform Evercore’s lagging position in
Britain, where since its founding in 2013 Robey Warshaw has consistently won
mandates against Wall Street’s dominant banks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It also settles a debate over the future of Robey Warshaw,
whose namesake founders — former Morgan Stanley executive Sir Simon Robey and
former UBS banker Simon Warshaw — are aged 65 and 59 respectively. With Philip
Apostolides, the trio carved a niche as advisers to blue-chip companies such as
BP, Vodafone, LSEG, National Grid, HSBC and Santander.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The firm has advised on many of the biggest-ticket UK deals
of the past decade, including the £79bn takeover of brewer SABMiller by AB
InBev, SoftBank’s £24bn purchase of chip designer Arm and LSEG’s $27bn
acquisition of data provider Refinitiv.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But it has added just two partners since its founding,
hiring Osborne in 2021 and JPMorgan financial services banker Chetan Singh last
year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“I don't think I’ve ever worked with a more talented, more
able banker than Simon Robey,” said Evercore’s founder and senior chair Roger
Altman in an interview. “Discussions evolved over a very long period of time
and they finally culminated in a mutual sense that this was the right thing to
do.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Evercore chief executive John Weinberg said that the deal
was “not a decision to pivot away from the US” but reflected the opportunity
the bank saw for European growth.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The firm has made Robey personally one of the UK’s best-paid
advisers, with more than £200mn in earnings since 2013, including £40.5mn in
the year to March 2024. Robey has consistently out-earned his fellow partners,
receiving close to 50 per cent or more of the firm’s profits each year. Robey
Warshaw reported turnover of £86mn last year and employs a total of 18 people.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Robey Warshaw partners have made a commitment of at
least six years to Evercore as part of the agreement, said people familiar with
the matter, with the bulk of payouts due to go to the three partners who
founded the firm.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We haven't done this to capitalise our careers and move on;
it’s financially attractive — but fairly so... it’s very much more this is
where I want to spend the balance of my career,” Robey said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The $196mn purchase price will be split into two tranches,
half in Evercore shares when the deal closes and the remainder a year later in
either cash or stock. There is also potential for Robey Warshaw’s partners to
secure further payouts over the next six years if they hit undisclosed
performance targets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Evercore will now have about 400 bankers in nine European
countries.</p><p class="MsoNormal">See Lex.</p></body></html>
