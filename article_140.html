they spoke of “inventions” or “the useful arts”. In early English usage,
“technology” referred to a treatise on technical subjects, not the tools
themselves. Its modern usage — which covers everything from toothpicks to
Teslas, and TikTok to tomahawks — gained ground in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, as engineering aligned itself with scientific authority and
institutional prestige.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The result is that “technology” has become a bloated
umbrella, spanning too much and clarifying too little. Nor is it alone in this
semantic stampede. Words like “innovation,” “smart” and “sustainability” have
suffered similar dilution, sprayed across policy memos and pitch decks until
their edges blur.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Vagueness offers alluring flexibility. Consultants peddle
“technology solutions” to undefined problems. More troubling, “tech company”
has become a convenient shield. Social platforms claim they are not publishers.
Ride-hailing services say they are not employers. Online marketplaces avoid
retail classification. Without distinction, accountability fades.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Precision still works, but only when we allow it. “Biotech”
emerged from the haze once investors needed a way to separate pills from
pixels. “Fintech” spans wire transfers and crypto speculation. “Edtech”
includes tutoring apps and loan servicers. “Agtech” groups robotic milkers with
gene-edited crops. “Cleantech” wraps battery storage, algae farms and “clean
coal” under the same feel-good brand. These tags reproduce confusion at smaller
scales.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Language, itself a technology, shapes how we understand
agency. “Technology is changing the workplace” conceals the fact that it is
executives who are choosing to automate processes and cut jobs. “Technology
connects us” hides the deliberate design of attention-harvesting systems. This
framing presents human decisions as inevitable outcomes of tools.</p><p class="MsoNormal">At its most insidious, “technology” flattens innovation
itself. Even “science and technology” — a favourite handle in policy circles —
makes engineers wince. The Hoover Dam, shares one designation with Snapchat,
despite their vast differences in form, intent and consequence.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Greeks had it right. Techné meant skilled craft, guided
by prudence and purpose. It described something made, named, practised and held
to account by people. From techné, we derived “technology.” Over time, however,
we traded clarity for cachet.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some languages still preserve the link between method and
meaning. German distinguishes between technik, the realm of practical methods,
and technologie, the study of those systems. Tamil speaks of thozhil nutpam,
the nuanced art of labour, where work is both diligent and dutiful. The
Japanese adopted tekunoroji because the native gijutsu was too civic-minded for
such abstraction. These distinctions retain what English often erases — and we
must recover them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Techné kept the maker in view: someone creating, naming,
guiding and standing by their work. The modern term slips past those
commitments. Ludwig Wittgenstein warned that “philosophical problems arise when
language goes on holiday.” “Technology” has been on an extended vacation. We’ve
retired words before, some for their harm, others because they wore out.
Technology now fits that second category. Let’s lay it to rest, not with
contempt, but with care. Only then can we see our tools, and ourselves, with
the precision they — and we — deserve.</p><p class="MsoNormal">— The writer is a systems engineer and author of <i>‘Wicked
