reinforcing the dominance of English in the workplace” (Work &amp; Careers,
July 21).</p><p class="MsoNormal">As a Londoner, who studied French and German, I fully agree
with his thesis, but would add a couple more points.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Native monolingual Anglo-Saxons are at a disadvantage. They
will lack the experience of operating in a foreign language and having to adapt
to a foreign culture. Working in the City of London surrounded by those for
whom English is at best a second language, daily reminds me that we
Anglo-Saxons do ourselves no favours. We often speak in ways that make us, at
times, near incomprehensible to non-native speakers. Speed of diction, choice
of vocabulary, obscure expressions compound to confuse good communication.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Moreover, the cultural awareness derived from having to
immerse oneself in the mannerisms and traditions of another civilisation opens
the mind and sharpens interpersonal skills. While Stem (science, technology,
engineering and mathematics) subjects are critical, it is foolish to ignore the
study of languages that offers an extraordinary insight into human
communications and culture, while at the same time developing critical
analytical faculties. These have certainly contributed to my own long career in
finance. Moreover, the multilingual young professional will outcompete the
monolingual Brit in the jobs market, all other things being equal.</p><p class="MsoNormal">So yes, being fluent in English is important for non-native
speakers, but the Anglo-Saxons still need to invest in linguistic skills,
including maybe more Arabic, Chinese and or other Asian languages for future
use. However, the statistics do not look good. Language study across the UK is
falling fast. This is really not a good thing for UK people.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Tim Skeet<br/>
