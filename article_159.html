congressional testimony about her former partner Jeffrey Epstein, posing a
dilemma for US President Donald Trump as he seeks to quash controversy around
the late paedophile financier’s case.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We would like to find a way to co-operate with Congress if
a fair and safe path forward can be established,” wrote lawyers representing
Maxwell in response to a congressional subpoena.</p><p class="MsoNormal">James Comer, chair of the House committee on oversight and
government reform, had requested Maxwell’s deposition from a Florida prison
where she is serving a 20-year sentence on sex trafficking charges.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The House committee said it “will not consider granting
congressional immunity for her testimony.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump said on Monday he had the authority to pardon Maxwell
but “nobody’s approached me about it” and it would be “inappropriate to talk
about it.” When a reporter asked Trump a question about Maxwell and Epstein on
Tuesday evening he responded: “Be quiet.” His comments came after deputy
attorney-general Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell in Florida last week.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The letter from Maxwell’s lawyers adds to the predicament
faced by the administration, which has come under attack from some Maga
supporters for its handling of files linked to Epstein, who killed himself in
2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><p class="MsoNormal">House Speaker Mike Johnson last week sent lawmakers home
early to avoid a vote on releasing files related to Epstein.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The case returned to the spotlight when a government memo
published this month found there was no Epstein “client list” and no “credible
evidence” the financier “blackmailed prominent individuals”—a U-turn from
Trump’s campaign promise to make public files relating to the disgraced
financier.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump sought to contain the pushback by directing US
attorney-general Pam Bondi to ask US courts to unseal grand jury transcripts
linked to Epstein and Maxwell—a request that one judge has already rejected.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The government’s efforts to quell anger over the case have
opened an avenue for Maxwell to fight her sentence. Maxwell, who has served
five years in prison, is seeking relief from legal proceedings her lawyers
claim were unfair.</p><p class="MsoNormal">She has also asked the US Supreme Court to reassess her
case, after arguing that a non-prosecution agreement the Department of Justice
struck with Epstein shielded her from being charged.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The DoJ objected, telling the top court that “this case
would be an unsuitable candidate for further review.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
