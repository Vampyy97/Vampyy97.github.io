deadline to meet a durable tariff agreement with the Trump administration
(“China at the negotiating table”, Unhedged, FT.com, July 23) from a hard
cut-off into a negotiable pause, opting to offer a tariff “freeze” rather than
a full rollback.</p><p class="MsoNormal">By framing their proposal as a temporary suspension, China
retains room to manoeuvre domestically, where monetary and fiscal tools are
already stretched, and maintains the narrative of strength at home.</p><p class="MsoNormal">At the same time, Chinese envoys signalled modest capacity
reductions in steel and other industries as symbolic concessions, a tactic that
reinforces mutual obligation without ceding the appearance of control.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This careful orchestration echoes the principle of guanxi:
each small gesture deepens interdependence, keeps US negotiators engaged and
allows Beijing to dictate the pace of talks rather than simply react to
Washington’s timetable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Beyond these surface moves, China has quietly shifted
attention to critical supply chains, reminding its counterpart that disruption
of rare earth magnet exports (where it supplies about 90 per cent of the world
market) would have immediate, tangible effects on US manufacturing.</p><p class="MsoNormal">By highlighting this less visible pressure point, Beijing
injects time sensitivity into the dialogue and reframes the discussion around
securing essential inputs, not just tariff levels.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For negotiation specialists, it’s a textbook demonstration
of creating visible tariff concessions buy goodwill and headlines, while
strategic control of vital materials ensures deeper stakes remain on the table.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In doing so, Chinese negotiators preserve the option to
tighten or loosen pressure in response to US proposals, keeping themselves
firmly in the driver’s seat of a more balanced, multi-dimensional negotiation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Alex Adamo<br/>
