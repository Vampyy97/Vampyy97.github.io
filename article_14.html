stocks to end post-Covid slump</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><img height="552" src="FT_files/image006.jpg" width="601"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">WILLIAM SANDLUND AND HAOHSIANG KO — HONG KONG<br/>
THOMAS HALE — SHANGHAI</p><p class="MsoNormal">Chinese investment flows to Hong Kong through the Stock
Connect programme have hit a record high as mainland capital drives a revival
of the territory’s equities market.</p><p class="MsoNormal">About HK$820bn (US$104bn) of Chinese money has been invested
this year through Stock Connect, which links the mainland’s stock exchanges to
Hong Kong’s, surpassing 2024's full-year inflow of HK$807.9bn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The surge has helped end a post-Covid slump in Hong Kong’s
financial markets and underlines how the city’s fortunes have become
increasingly dependent on policy in Beijing and on Chinese capital.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It also points to a growing appetite among Chinese investors
to put money to work outside the mainland’s tightly controlled financial
system, as yields on government bonds have fallen to record lows amid an
uncertain economic backdrop.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Domestic investors are now waking up to the opportunity
offshore,” said Jason Lui, head of Asia-Pacific equity and derivative strategy
at BNP Paribas. “If you're [Chinese] institutional investors, you have no
choice but to start looking outward. There’s actually limited choices for where
you can go.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Stock Connect programme, which started in 2014, allows
Chinese retail investors with at least Rmb500,000 ($70,000) to access Hong
Kong’s financial markets without violating China’s strict capital controls.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Cumulative investment into Hong Kong through Stock Connect
has reached HK$4.5tn, with more than a third of inflows occurring in the past
two years. Southbound transactions now make up about a quarter of daily
turnover on the Hong Kong exchange’s main board, compared with well below 10
per cent on most days in 2019.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The programme is one of the only ways Chinese investors can
buy shares of technology companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, which
are listed in Hong Kong but not in the mainland. Their shares have rallied
sharply this year following the release of a groundbreaking artificial
intelligence model by Chinese start-up DeepSeek and signs of easing tensions
between China’s tech sector and regulators.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hong Kong’s listings pipeline has hit a record high this
year as mainland companies pursue secondary listings in the city. “The Hong
Kong stock exchange has become the main platform for mainland companies to
raise offshore capital,” said David Tsai, a partner at law firm Clifford
Chance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hong Kong’s turnaround has helped rekindle investor interest
in Chinese businesses that were hit by a government crackdown on the private
sector and a property market slowdown now in its fourth year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The longer-term outlook for Hong Kong has improved,” said
James Wang, head of China equity strategy at UBS. “You're not hearing investors
saying: ‘Is China investable any more?’ That kind of rhetoric is well and truly
behind us.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
