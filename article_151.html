€170bn budget shortfall poses a “massive challenge” to the ruling coalition
even as Europe’s largest economy embarks on a debt-funded splurge to bolster
its military and modernise its infrastructure.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In March, Germany relaxed its constitutional borrowing limit
to enable increased defence spending and to set up a €500bn special fund for
its ageing infrastructure — a historic pivot from Berlin’s traditionally
conservative fiscal stance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However, the constitutional rule that limits net borrowing
to 0.35 per cent of GDP annually continues to apply to other areas of the
federal budget.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Presenting next year’s budget yesterday, Klingbeil said
Berlin must close a budget hole of €170bn by 2029. As the coalition agreed not
to increase taxes, this was likely to require deep cuts across ministries and
reforms of the welfare system, he added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“There is no time to waste,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The 2027 budget alone will have to cover a €30bn gap, “one
of the biggest domestic challenges that we have to overcome in the next 12
months”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“It may seem paradoxical,” said Jens Siudekum, an economist
who advises Klingbeil. “With the reform of the debt brake, the casual observer
may think there’s money for everything, but that’s not the case.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The looming cuts pose a political risk for the government
led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has pledged to move from the infighting
that plagued the previous coalition.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Merz’s Christian Democrats, who govern with Klingbeil’s
Social Democrats with a razor-thin majority of 13 seats in parliament, have
lately experienced their first significant tensions since taking office in May.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This month the chancellor was forced to delay a
parliamentary vote on nominating three Supreme Court judges at the last minute
because of dissent within his own ranks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In June, Markus Söder, the leader of the CSU, the CDU’s
Bavarian sister party, criticised Klingbeil for failing to deliver on
electricity price cuts for consumers. In return, Söder secured an early
implementation of a campaign promise of offering additional benefits to
mothers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The coalition also agreed to offset revenue losses for
municipalities resulting from planned corporate tax cuts, while the finance
ministry raised its interest payment forecasts upwards in light of increased
borrowings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The squeeze comes amid persistent uncertainty over Germany’s
growth prospects. The export-heavy economy has stagnated over the past five
years and is the most exposed to planned US tariffs of 15 per cent on EU goods.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Siudekum estimates that the tariffs could shave 0.2 to 0.3
points off GDP growth.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A finance ministry official noted that the government's
growth assumptions remained cautious — zero projected for this year, and 1 per
cent annually between 2026 and 2029. Some analysts predict that Germany could
grow by up to 2 per cent next year thanks to its spending plan in defence and
infrastructure and tax cuts aimed at spurring corporate spending.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The nice solution would be that growth picks up,” Siudekum
said, adding, however, that it would not be enough to plug the budget gap.</p></body></html>
