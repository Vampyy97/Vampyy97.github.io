all our political, public service and economic woes is the lack of economic
growth. The economic potential of the majority of the British people who don’t
live in Greater London is overlooked.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The 2008 financial crisis hit the UK particularly hard
because our economy was so centred on finance. The Conservatives responded with
the economic equivalent of leeches — sustained austerity. The result has been
the slow strangulation of the economy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Under these profound policy mistakes lies a multi-decade
failure to foster geographically even economic growth. From a productivity and
GDP per head perspective we are two nations: Greater London and the Southeast,
and everywhere else. This means there is a huge opportunity to improve
productivity and output. Even small increases in productivity beyond London and
the Southeast would break the stranglehold of stagnation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">GDP per head in the UK averages just over £39,000. Every
region is below that except the Southeast at £41,000 and London at a whopping
£69,000. My region, the Northeast, is the lowest at £28,000, despite having
world-leading companies and research institutions.</p><p class="MsoNormal">We see the same disparities when we look at labour
productivity, which is also indirectly a measure of capital investment both
physical and human. At 86 per cent of the national average per head, the
Northeast’s has barely changed in two decades. If we could just lift that GDP
to the national average it would increase UK GDP by 1.14 per cent — almost the
same GDP growth for the entire country in 2024. If we could do the same for the
next lowest region — Wales — that would add a further 1.2 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">That picture is reflected across the country. If the Tories
had matched their talk of levelling up with action on regional productivity and
per capita GDP we could have had healthy economic growth for every year but the
Covid year of 2020 and 2023, which followed Liz Truss’s economic disruption.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There are some hard truths embedded in this data. First, a
London-centred approach to economic policy cannot bring back healthy growth for
the nation. Second, the gross inequality in economic output is a consequence of
decades of under-investment elsewhere and can only be addressed by smart
strategic investment and effective public-private co-operation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Today, investment has to mean science and technology. In our
enquiry into regional innovation and growth, the select committee has taken
wide-ranging evidence. From the education and skilling of the workforce, to
technology and capital deployment in businesses, start ups and spin outs, to
lab facilities and “catapult” tech centres, to internet and transport
connectivity, disparities need to be addressed. That means building on the
existing business and technology strengths of the diverse regions, and, in particular,
mayors. Working with regional governments must take up this agenda. And it must
begin with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology — but not end
there. Lifting productivity must be a co-ordinated project across government.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Labour has inherited a destructive legacy of stagnation and
regional underdevelopment. It has made some, limited, progress, increasing
investment in science and transport and extending devolution. Unfortunately, my
committee’s work has also revealed an enduring complacency and lack of regional
lens in many Whitehall departments. If that parochialism is left undisturbed we
will remain two countries when it comes to productivity and output — suffering
economic stagnation while staring at the solution.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The writer is Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central and
