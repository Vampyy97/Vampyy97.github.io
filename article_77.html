Tariff and geopolitical jolts should, in theory, push prices higher for
derivatives that insure against debt default and widen the spread of interest
rates of credit over benchmarks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet, in 2025, the louder the headlines, the quieter the
market gauges of risk have become.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While there could be a small pothole of volatility ahead,
expectations of volatility implied by pricing on options contracts have fallen
for two years. The yield premiums offered to woo investors on bond issues match
pre-pandemic lows. And key indices of the cost of credit default swaps — which
act as a kind of insurance on debt — sit near long-term lows.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Why does anxiety coexist with such market pricing? Because
the US has quietly become one of the world’s most shock-resistant economies.
That resilience not only supports stocks, it also lets investors lock in
once-in-a-generation income on high-grade bonds that serve as a ballast
alongside riskier positions.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Services now generate 81 per cent of US GDP and 69 per cent
of consumer spending, up from 38 per cent in the 1940s. Real services
consumption has contracted only twice year on year — in 2009 and 2020; the
higher the services share, the smoother the cycle.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Digitised supply chains and flexible labour markets blunt
default risk and reduce earnings shocks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Households are stronger, too. Debt to net worth is near
all-time lows, 50 per cent below 2008 highs. And net worth stands at 7.6 times
disposable income — higher than anytime pre-pandemic. Total household interest
costs are under 10 per cent of income — lower than any pre-pandemic reading on
record. The average mortgage rate outstanding is just 4.05 per cent, keeping
interest payments at 4 per cent of income. Meanwhile, Americans have more
equity in their homes than ever before.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Corporate balance sheets mirror that discipline. Investment
grade issuers spent the past decade lengthening the duration of their debt and
building cash. Household and business leverage is more than 30 per cent below
the Great Financial Crisis highs and profit margins sit at 13.8 per cent,
higher than any pre-pandemic reading on record.</p><p class="MsoNormal">With no balance sheet faultline, forced deleveraging — the
kind that ignites volatility — never starts.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Households hold financial assets worth $129tn with about
half sitting in assets yielding north of 4 per cent, meaning that reinvestment
needs become self-fulfilling. That cash hunt yields every day, creating a
persistent bid for corporates and securitised assets. Dealers keep lighter
inventories, trading spreads compress and price swings shrink.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There was a tariff scare earlier this year but the shock
fizzled. While risk premia are tight, yields are not. Treasury yields are still
above 4 per cent and inflation has cooled to just above 2 per cent. Positive
real yields after taking into account inflation are the richest for at least 15
years.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A diversified portfolio of A rated debt earns 6-7 per cent
income with roughly 3 per cent volatility in price movements. Securitised
assets and private credit add equity-like returns with loss expectations akin
to investment grade debt. With selective use of options, fixed income returns
can plausibly reach high single-digits without chasing junk-rated debt. Such
returns are an attractive ballast for portfolios today.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Simultaneously, breakthroughs in AI, cloud, robotics and
other productivity-enhancing forms of technology are creating unique upside in
equities. Valuations may look full but cash flow generation continues to
eclipse expectations. Record cash levels seen in money market funds, aggressive
corporate buybacks and a thin calendar of IPOs keep demand ahead of supply.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Markets are not ignoring risk — they are pricing a system
built to absorb it. A service-oriented economy, fortress balance sheets and a
liquidity-rich investor base deliver a two-for-one: resilient growth and
elevated fixed income yields.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Investors should lean into this — maintain equity exposure
to ride durable earnings growth; tilt bond holdings towards the higher quality
end of the market; and augment portfolios with uncorrelated assets such as real
estate, private investments and even a measured allocation to crypto.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Done thoughtfully, the portfolio can compound at high
single-digit rates, even if geopolitical drama dominates the headlines. In
2025, the loudest noises come from headlines, not the trading floor.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Rick Rieder is chief investment officer of global fixed
