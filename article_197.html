donor fatigue and nationalist politics have eroded the once-dominant western
development model. But as governments pull back, a new actor has stepped in.
Artificial intelligence is being deployed with a speed and reach that
traditional organisations struggle to match. Code — not cash — is the new
foreign aid.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Across the global south, AI is already doing some of the
work that aid agencies once dominated. Ubenwa’s neonatal diagnostic app in
Nigeria, Somanssi’s AI tutor in Kenya and Hello Tractor’s AI-enabled fleet
management for small farmers are delivering essential services where public
institutions are overstretched or absent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Who is delivering this AI-powered development? It’s not the
World Bank or USAID. Instead, tech companies like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and
Nvidia, alongside local civic-tech innovators, are stepping forward.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Consider what has already been rolled out. In the past year
OpenAI has partnered with a primary care provider in Kenya to support local AI
development in healthcare. In South Africa, billionaire Strive Masiyiwa worked
with Nvidia to launch the continent’s first “AI factory” — a Johannesburg-based
hub designed to train local talent and build regionally relevant models. In
Kenya and Ghana, Google is investing in AI research centres. These projects are
not labelled as foreign aid, but they’re delivering infrastructure, skills, and
tools in exactly the areas where traditional donors have pulled back.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This work isn’t altruism, it’s strategy. The Trump
administration’s recently released AI Action Plan makes the point explicit: AI
is now a core pillar of foreign policy. The plan outlines a bold objective —
exporting “the full AI stack” (from chips to models to standards) to build
alliances, spread American values and counter Chinese influence in emerging
markets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But those values are not always clear — or universally
shared. Alongside the push to expand access to “responsible AI,” US
policymakers are backing efforts to remove what some see as “woke” elements
from AI models — curbing progressive language on race, gender and history.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It is also worth distinguishing between tech companies that
operate as agents of government strategy and those who act independently. While
Chinese firms often align closely with state-backed development goals, many
western AI companies follow commercial incentives — yet their actions can still
serve national interests by entrenching influence, standards and dependencies
abroad, whether intentionally or not.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This raises important questions. What norms and political
assumptions are being embedded in the AI models that are exported? And will
AI-as-aid replicate old dependencies in a more sophisticated form?</p><p class="MsoNormal">AI development may be fast and scalable — but it is not
immune to the problems that have plagued foreign aid. Many of these tools
depend on high energy use, commercial licences and recurring model updates —
opening the door to problems with sustainability, affordability and lack of
local control.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To avoid repeating past mistakes, we need a new global
framework. Just as Bretton Woods reimagined aid for the postwar world, a
blueprint for the AI century is required — one in which compute access, data
infrastructure and open models are treated as public goods. That means
supporting regional training data, funding inclusive language models and
investing in local talent pipelines.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The global development sector, still reeling from
post-pandemic cutbacks and crises, would do well to pay attention. Whether we
are ready or not, the code diplomat has arrived.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>The writer is a global risk futurist at NYU and leads AI
