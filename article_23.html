technologies that define<br/>
our age: smartphones,<br/>
search engines and social<br/>
networks. In his sprightly<br/>
book exploring global tech<br/>
hotspots Mehran Gul asks:<br/>
is that now changing?</p><p class="MsoNormal">Anyone familiar with<br/>
Betteridge's law of<br/>
headlines may not be<br/>
surprised by the answer:<br/>
no. With the partial<br/>
exception of China, Gul<br/>
argues the US still out-<br/>
innovates the rest of the<br/>
world. In 1990 the US<br/>
accounted for 39 per cent<br/>
of the GDP of G7 nations.<br/>
Today it stands at 57 per<br/>
cent. It's "hard to avoid the<br/>
conclusion that predictions<br/>
of American decline<br/>
vastly exaggerated," Gul<br/>
concludes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The reader senses this<br/>
was not the answer Gul<br/>
was hoping for. But credit<br/>
to him for following the<br/>
evidence. Interviewing 200<br/>
entrepreneurs, investors<br/>
and policymakers globally,<br/>
he highlights the strengths<br/>
and weaknesses of the US,<br/>
China, the UK, Korea,<br/>
Singapore, Germany and<br/>
Canada. He acknowledges<br/>
he focuses on big tech; had<br/>
he expanded his focus he<br/>
might have come to the<br/>
slightly different<br/>
conclusions argued in<br/>
another recent book on<br/>
east Asian innovation:<br/>
Startup Capitalism by<br/>
Robyn Klingler-Vidra and<br/>
Ramon Pacheco Pardo. But<br/>
when it comes to building<br/>
world-beating tech, Gul is<br/>
surely right to say: "The<br/>
Americans are not in a<br/>
different league. They're<br/>
playing a different game."</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>John Thornhill</i></p></body></html>
