Washington trade deal</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><img height="373" src="FT_files/image027.jpg" width="601"/></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Jitters in Paris and Berlin • Big drop for euro • Carmakers

long-awaited trade deal with the US, warning that it would wound the European
economy as the euro slid against the dollar.</p><p class="MsoNormal">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the agreement
concluded with US President Donald Trump the day before would cause
“considerable damage” to his country, Europe and the US itself. “Not only will
there be a higher inflation rate, but it will also affect transatlantic trade
overall,” Merz said, in a striking rebuke of the deal negotiated by European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The euro was down more than 1 per cent against the dollar
and fell 0.8 per cent against the pound, following the announcement on Sunday
that the US would impose 15 per cent tariffs on most imports from the EU.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“This result cannot satisfy us,” Merz added. “But it was the
best result achievable in a given situation.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said the deal marked a
“dark day,” adding that the EU had “resigned itself into submission.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The agreement, hailed by Von der Leyen as “the biggest trade
deal ever” and covering nearly 44 per cent of global GDP, averted a possible
transatlantic trade war. It secured a lower tariff rate for the EU than the 30
per cent that Trump had threatened to impose from August 1. But the duties
still mark a threefold increase from the average tariffs imposed on the bloc by
the US before Trump’s “liberation day” announcements in April.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Germany's Dax closed 1.1 per cent lower yesterday while
France’s Cac 40 gave up 0.4 per cent and tariff-exposed car industry stocks on
the region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.8 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While the euro fell yesterday, it remains 12 per cent higher
against the dollar for the year, boosted by Germany’s defence spending plans as
well as broader investor hopes that Trump’s America First policies will
encourage a wave of economic stimulus in the EU.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The bloc’s steel producers’ industry body said a 15 per cent
tariff on most exports would add a “huge burden” on its members.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US Chamber of Commerce in the EU said the deal “provides
relief” to businesses. But it added that the 15 per cent tariff rate “still
marks a significant increase in the cost of trading” and that more sectors
should be included in the agreement's zero-for-zero tariffs list.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The White House said the deal “achieves historic structural
reforms and strategic commitments that will benefit American industry, workers
and national security for generations.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">As Europe's leaders reacted, Spanish premier Pedro Sanchez
said he supported it “without enthusiasm.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">French and German far-right parties said the deal exposed EU
weakness. Alice Weidel, co-leader of Alternative for Germany, said it was “not
an agreement but a slap in the face to European consumers and producers!”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Reactions came as Trump and UK premier Sir Keir Starmer met
at the US president's Turnberry golf club in Scotland to discuss Britain’s
trade deal with the US, and wars in Ukraine and Gaza.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump said he planned to set a tariff of up to 20 per cent
“for essentially the rest of the world,” referring to nations that have not
struck agreements with the US. He would unveil pharmaceuticals tariffs “in the
near future.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Reporting by Aime Williams in Washington, Alice Hancock
