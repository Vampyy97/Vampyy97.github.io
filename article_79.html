to Israeli offensive</p><p class="MsoNormal">Rarely has the world had such visibility of mass human
suffering as in Gaza. Images from the besieged Palestinian enclave are
graphically displaying the death and destruction wrought by Israel’s nearly
22-month offensive. Women clutching horribly emaciated children. War-scarred
hospitals struggling to treat streams of wounded. The dead lined up in rows in
body bags. Mass starvation is stalking the strip.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet Israeli soldiers have killed hundreds of people trekking
to aid distribution centres operated under a flawed Israeli- and US-backed
system that breaks with usual humanitarian models. The number of Palestinians
killed by Israel’s offensive is nearing 60,000, according to local health
officials.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Across the strip, entire towns have been razed, with most of
the 2.1mn population herded into barren wastelands. Israeli defence minister
Israel Katz has told local media he wants to establish a “humanitarian city” in
southern Gaza to house 600,000 people and later the entire population.</p><p class="MsoNormal">When Israel first launched its offensive, most of the world
stood by a nation traumatised by the abhorrent October 7 2023 attack by Hamas,
the Palestinian militant group, that killed 1,200 people. Other nations
supported Israel’s right to self-defence, to hold the perpetrators to account
and to attempt to secure the release of 250 hostages seized. Hamas should have
released all hostages long ago. Its use of them as bargaining chips is
despicable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But Israel's offensive has long gone beyond all bounds of a
proportionate response. The longer it has continued, the more it has borne the
hallmarks of a vengeful assault by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
far-right government to destroy the very fabric of Palestinian society.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The pattern is repeated, on a lesser scale, in the occupied
West Bank. Israeli military operations and Jewish settler violence have forced
thousands from their homes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A small but increasing number of genocide scholars are
concluding that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide. On Monday,
B’Tselem, a respected Israeli rights group, reached the same verdict. In a
report, it said Israel’s policy and “its horrific outcomes ... leads to the
unequivocal conclusion that Israel is taking co-ordinated action to
intentionally destroy Palestinian society in the Gaza Strip.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Israel bitterly rejects the allegation. But evidence of
ethnic cleansing is mounting, with the population forcibly displaced multiple
times under the threat of military action. Aid is also indisputably being
weaponised, and an entire community collectively punished for Hamas's appalling
actions.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet Israel’s western allies still refuse to take the
necessary steps to pressure Netanyahu to end its war — above all the Trump
administration, which has the most leverage. Other western nations’
condemnations are not enough. Unless the Israeli government agrees to an
immediate end to the war and a surge of aid into Gaza, western countries should
be sanctioning Netanyahu and his government. They should halt all arms sales to
Israel. More should follow French President Emmanuel Macron’s lead and recognise
a Palestinian state.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Arab nations could also be doing more. Egypt, Jordan, the
United Arab Emirates and others that have relations with Israel should make
clear those diplomatic ties cannot be sustained without a radical change of
course.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Israel this weekend announced “tactical pauses” and
“humanitarian corridors”, in a sign that Netanyahu’s government is not immune
to outside pressure. But it is far too little, far too late. The world is
failing the Palestinian people — a failure that will haunt western nations in
particular for years to come.</p></body></html>
