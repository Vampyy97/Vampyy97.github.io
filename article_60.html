McMorrow — Shanghai</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison has said that it
plans to bring on a “major” Chinese investor for a consortium backed by US
asset manager BlackRock, as the company seeks Beijing’s approval for a $23bn
ports sale that includes key assets in the Panama Canal.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While CK Hutchison did not name the investor, four people
close to the discussions said China’s state-owned shipping conglomerate Cosco
was in talks to join the group that includes Swiss-Italian shipping company
MSC.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Under one of the options being discussed, Cosco would
receive a stake in 41 global ports but not the two Panama Canal ports that US
President Donald Trump has alleged are subject to Chinese influence, said three
of the people.</p><p class="MsoNormal">CK Hutchison shares yesterday closed almost 1 per cent off
after the announcement, after climbing 9 per cent in the past week on hopes for
the deal. Cosco Shipping Holdings’ Hong Kong shares fell nearly 3 per cent. The
companies did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by billionaire Li
Ka-shing in March announced plans to sell its portfolio of 43 non-Chinese
ports, including two in the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by Terminal
Investment Limited, majority owned by MSC, and BlackRock’s unit Global
Infrastructure Partners.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"The group remains in discussions with members of the
consortium with a view to inviting major strategic investor from the PRC to
join as a significant member of the consortium," CK Hutchison said in a
filing to Hong Kong’s stock exchange yesterday, cautioning that “there can be
no certainty that the discussions for the New Arrangements will reach a
successful conclusion.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">An exclusive negotiation window between CK Hutchison and the
consortium expired on Sunday after Beijing expressed frustration over the deal,
arguing that it would hand controlling power of strategic global ports to
western investors.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Under initial deal arrangements, BlackRock would take a
controlling stake in the two Panama ports, and MSC would hold majority
ownership of the rest of CK Hutchison’s 41 global ports including those in
Europe, south-east Asia and the Middle East.</p><p class="MsoNormal">China has been pushing for Cosco to be involved in the deal
and the consortium is likely to accept, according to a person close to the
deal, as it could help with getting it past the country’s antitrust regulator.</p><p class="MsoNormal">China’s foreign ministry yesterday said that Beijing was
aware of the announcement and that it would regulate the deal in accordance
with the law to “safeguard national sovereignty and security” and maintain
“market fairness and justice.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in London and
