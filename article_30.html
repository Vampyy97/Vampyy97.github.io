excessive competition</p><p class="MsoNormal">China shows no sign of securing lasting victory in its
battle with deflation. Although annual consumer price inflation turned positive
in June — for the first time since January — there are few who believe that
sustained price growth is returning. A lack of demand remains a problem.
Beijing has made a few efforts to encourage consumers, but it will need to go
further, including by bolstering the country’s patchy benefit and pension
provisions, which incentivise precautionary savings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Either way, there is little hope of China beating
deflationary dynamics unless the Chinese Communist party addresses the other
side of the ledger too — that of excessive supply.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Annual growth in producer prices has been negative since
October 2022. Limited appetite among consumers at home forces Chinese factories
to keep prices down in order to grab as much market share as possible. But low
prices in China’s supply chains are also the inevitable consequence of
aggressive competition in traditional industries such as steel and cement, and
modern ones, including electric vehicles, solar panels and artificial
intelligence.</p><p class="MsoNormal">After initially denying foreign concerns about overcapacity,
Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leading officials have attacked domestic
manufacturers for what they call <i>neijuan</i>, or “involution” which, when
applied to industry, alludes to excessive price competition. Beijing’s own
policies are largely to blame.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Over recent years, the president has reiterated the
importance of “new quality productive forces” to China’s economic progress. The
strategy emphasises the development of advanced technologies and new
industries. This is triggering a free for all in the country’s state-led
capitalist model. Businesses clamber into new industries to attract political
support and prestige. Local governments — with their own economic targets,
handed down from the centre — then tend to shower emerging industries with
subsidies, tax breaks and protections.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But the result is a surge in investment, rife with
duplication. Factories and production lines are often established with little
regard for downstream demand. As stock piles up, retail prices get slashed —
sometimes below cost — as producers try to maintain their market share. Ports
are turned into EV car parks, and AI chips lie idle in newly constructed data
centres.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It is getting harder for Chinese manufacturers to export
this oversupply. Its trading partners now have heightened awareness of the
impact of importing cheap products on their domestic industries.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Beijing is trying to pressure provincial politicians and
industries to clamp down on “involution”. The cement, steel and construction
sectors have all suggested they will make adjustments. Controlling
hyper-competitive industries, however, will not be straightforward without
significant reforms.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The state’s largesse needs to be curbed; a unified national
market might help restrain local governments’ ability to offer distorting
incentives. Shifting provincial targets away from GDP would alleviate the
narrow focus on output. Tighter intellectual property frameworks could slash
duplication and encourage more innovative differentiation. In other words,
Beijing needs to nurture the conditions for freer and fairer competition.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It’s possible that Xi focuses on setting caps and pressuring
producers to reduce output. He may be conscious of overcorrecting since he has
made modern manufacturing the central pillar of China’s growth model. But
Beijing will do well to realise that its excessive support is the problem. The
state can build factories — but it can’t manufacture efficiency.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
