serious-newsreader voice — over a piece of generic classical library music and
drone footage of some random hills, I knew it was going to be bad: “Britain. An
ancient place.” But I don't think I realised quite how bad GB News’s “Yookay vs
Britain: How immigration transformed a nation” documentary was going to get.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This was to be a “deep dive into Britain’s exponential
change in the face of uncontrolled mass migration”, we are told. “At the turn
of the millennium, Britain took a radical new path on immigration . . . was
Britain ready for this?” the blurb reads.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The funny thing was, that question is never addressed. The
majority of the first half of the documentary focuses on the violence of UK
“drill” music, during which we are shown extensive interviews with two
British-born musicians. The rest largely consists of some pretty transparent
race-baiting and non sequiturs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“This is a story about immigration,” the presenter Steven
Edginton tells us in his voiceover, as we are shown footage of a Black woman
being asked what it means to be British. “It means that although I’m British
and I’m born in this country, that I'm still rejected as a Black person,” she
replies. “Welcome to the yookay,” he continues, as if she somehow represented
something we are to think of as abhorrent, while we’re shown footage of various
ethnic minorities.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The “yookay” is a reference to “Yookay Aesthetics”, a
satirical account on X devoted to “chronicling the new Britain AKA ‘the
Yookay’”. It posts images of multicultural Britain — halal butchers, Deliveroo
riders and shops with foreign names all feature. Posts from recent days include
one captioned “Indian man showers in River Thames” (showing a fully dressed man
with his feet in the water) and a notice about a proposed new mosque in Dover.
“Aesthetics account — posts are not implicit value judgments”, the account’s
bio reads.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Similarly, the documentary never actually says anything
explicitly racist. Instead, it shows us a series of vox pops with people in the
streets of Brixton — four Black, two white — who are asked about British values
and to give their opinions on “Great British heroes” like Alfred the Great,
Lord Nelson and, er, Henry VIII.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But one of the vox pops didn’t go down quite the way GB News
might have hoped. It showed a young, British-born Black man explaining why he
loves Britain but then struggling to respond to what he considers to be British
values — “is it something to do with the cost of living or something?” he asks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“You’ve plastered this video all over your social media
channels, taking advantage of my autistic older brother for views and to push
your weird anti-black narrative,” his brother posted on X in response to the
clip. “As a news company that <i>should</i> be responsible, this shouldn’t have
been posted but oh well.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Quite. And I wasn’t the only one to agree. Among those to
call out GB News were one of their own presenters, Martin Daubney, who asked,
“How many white kids would know about Alfred the Great?” (not to mention
adults), and the former leader of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson,
who deemed it “a liberty” (i.e., out of order) and said the interviewee was
“not a problem”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It is an astonishing demonstration of the broader cultural
and political shift to the right — not to the traditional, conservative right
but to the far more “based”, vice-signalling, Very Online right — that GB News,
a channel that claims to stand for “the Great British culture of honour”
thought it could get away with this kind of nasty, low-quality content.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Part of this shift is about a backlash to the censoriousness
and identity politics that has dominated culture for several years and that
peaked in 2020. But it is also a product of the fragmentation of the internet
into a series of homogenous silos, particularly since Elon Musk’s takeover of
what was then Twitter — and the mass X-odus of liberals, primarily to Bluesky.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Spend any time on X and the algorithms will rapidly serve
you up a whole slew of content aimed at stirring up hatred — often along racial
or religious lines. It is a depressing experience. And the problem is that
precisely because of how awful so much of it is, those who consider it as such
aren’t around to call it out.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It seems unthinkable to me that this “documentary” would
have come out even three years ago; the nastiest part of the right has become
hugely emboldened. And while these might be new online echo chambers, what they
are peddling is simply old-fashioned racism and bigotry.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
