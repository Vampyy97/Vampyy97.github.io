agreement on one point: if Donald Trump went ahead with tariffs, it would
strengthen the dollar and trigger stagflation. Chief executives, investors and
commentators all said the same. Economists estimated that every percentage
point increase in the tariff rate would shave 0.1 per cent off US growth and
add 0.1 per cent to inflation. But so far, the consequences have been far less
disruptive than just about anyone expected.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some analysts still think that’s because Trump’s threats
have been mostly posturing. But the effective US tariff rate has already risen
from 2.5 per cent to 15 per cent. Tariff revenue is rolling in at an annual
rate above $300bn, roughly four times the pace this time last year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Many economists had assumed that, by lowering imports,
tariffs would strengthen the dollar almost automatically, as an accounting
identity. Instead, it suffered its worst fall over the first half of a year
since the early 1970s.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This unexpected turn is now attributed to the fact that the
dollar started the year historically overvalued. Many foreigners were heavily
exposed to dollar assets. Of late, they have been hedging those risks and
investing more outside the US. Many countries are increasingly attractive
places to park money, in part because tariff threats inspired them to push
economic reform and cut trade deals with non-US partners.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The bigger mystery is why the stagflationary impact of
tariffs has yet to materialise in the aggregate data. Is the US really enjoying
a free lunch, taking in $300bn a year in tariff revenues with none of the
expected heartburn? By some estimates, foreign exporters are indeed absorbing
20 per cent of the costs — a much larger share than they did in response to
tariffs in Trump’s first term.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The remaining 80 per cent, however, is still getting paid in
roughly equal shares by US corporations and consumers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The likely answer is that the negative economic effect of
tariffs is being countered by other forces, including the mania for artificial
intelligence and more government stimulus. Since January, estimates of what the
big tech companies will spend this year on building out AI infrastructure have
risen $60bn to $350bn. Smaller businesses are scrambling to catch the wave too,
further boosting growth. And all this excitement is neutralising the fear that
trade policy uncertainty would dampen animal spirits and freeze new capex.</p><p class="MsoNormal">AI-driven bullishness is also lifting growth by keeping
financial conditions loose, even with higher interest rates. According to a new
index from the Federal Reserve, those conditions would be neutral, not loose,
were it not for the stock market, which has continued rising this year due
largely to AI stocks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, the promise of tax relief makes it easier for US
corporations to absorb a larger than expected share of the tariff costs, rather
than pass it all on to consumers. Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is expected to
save US businesses around $100bn this year and more than that in 2026, mainly
in tax breaks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">That is not to say tariffs have no negative economic effect.
The costs are in fact starting to show up in higher prices for major household
appliances, sporting goods and toys.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet the overall inflation rate has been held in check by
falling rents and prices for other kinds of goods, including used cars and
energy. And those prices are declining for reasons unrelated to tariffs;
used-car prices are still retreating from highs created by supply disruptions
during the pandemic.</p><p class="MsoNormal">So economists were not entirely wrong about the tariffs. And
stagflation may yet materialise, particularly if the average effective rate
continues to climb. But so far even a much higher rate has not been enough to
overwhelm the larger forces sustaining growth and containing inflation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a way what we are seeing is a replay of 2023. That year,
too, many expected a big shock (then mainly from Fed rate rises) to
dramatically slow US growth, only to find the impact offset by the AI spending
boom and the US government’s seemingly bottomless capacity to keep doling out
fiscal support.</p><p class="MsoNormal">What the world got wrong, then and now, starts with its
mental frameworks. The timeworn mistake of employing simple models, in which a
headline-grabbing input A leads in a straight line to outcome B, has been
greatly magnified by the global obsession with Trump. He is the only input
anyone cares to analyse anymore. But complex economies are rarely shaped by
just one factor, not even a shock as big as Trump’s trade policy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The writer is chair of Rockefeller International. His latest
