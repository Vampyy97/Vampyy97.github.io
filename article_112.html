world</h2><p class="MsoNormal">Sensodyne, the toothpaste first marketed in 1961 to reduce
the pain of sensitive teeth, is among premium brands on sale in pharmacies and
drug stores around the world. But if you live in an Indian village, Sensodyne
is surprisingly cheap.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sachets of Sensodyne for about a week’s use are now on sale
for 20 rupees (about 17p) in 10,000 villages. Having been offered chilled water
to test for dental sensitivity by Haleon, the UK consumer health group that
owns the brand, many are trying it out.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Thanks to its 1.4bn population, India is Sensodyne’s second
biggest market in the world after the US, which has annual sales of about £2bn.
It is not the only Haleon product being sold there in sample-like packs:
Indians can buy 10-rupee sachets of Centrum vitamin powder and Eno indigestion
tablets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The beauty of India is that the population is upwardly
mobile,” says Jayant Singh, Haleon’s head of global oral health. That makes it
ideal for Haleon, which was spun off from the UK pharma company GSK three years
ago, and has since outperformed its former parent on the stock market. Haleon,
which Unilever tried to buy for £50bn before the initial public offering, had a
market capitalisation of £33bn on Monday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Haleon remains less known than the brands it inherited from
a GSK, Pfizer and Novartis joint venture, including the painkillers Advil and
Panadol.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It is still trying to rationalise its operations and make
its name, with Pfizer selling the last of its 32 per cent stake in March. The
company announces its half-year results tomorrow.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Despite their evident value, consumer health divisions of
pharma groups never got much respect: the reliable revenues of over-the-counter
brands were less interesting than a pipeline of new drugs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“I used to sit there thinking, ‘I wish they would ask me a
question,’” recalls Brian McNamara, Haleon chief executive, of past investor
meetings at GSK when he ran its consumer health side.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But consumer health has become its own industry, with
Johnson &amp; Johnson spinning off health brands including Tylenol and
Listerine into Kenvue in 2023, and Sanofi selling 50 per cent of its Opella
division to the private equity group CD&amp;R this April. Haleon has worked
better than Kenvue, which ousted its chief executive Thibaut Mongon this month
following activist pressure.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Haleon has risen in value slowly: its 11 per cent share
price rise since its IPO is below that of the FTSE 100 index. But personal
health is in vogue among consumer staples companies because top brands have
higher margins and sales growth than food or cleaning products.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Having failed to snag Haleon, Unilever is trying to shift
towards personal care and beauty itself.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sensodyne’s growth since being acquired in 2000 by GSK’s
predecessor SmithKline Beecham illustrates why. “People are far more interested
in health since Covid and there is strong loyalty to the brands that
pharmacists or dentists recommend,” says Warren Ackerman, an analyst at
Barclays. What was a niche product has overtaken Aquafresh, another Haleon
brand.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The marketing formula was developed in the US and Europe
before being moved to Asia. Haleon runs clinical trials on brand extensions
such as Sensodyne Clinical White, which contains desensitising and whitening
chemicals. Sales representatives visit dentists with samples to convince them
to recommend it, while Haleon promotes “condition awareness” among people who
have lived with the pain.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Science is rooted in the company, given its history within a
pharma group. But Haleon also uses mass marketing in a way akin to Unilever or
Reckitt.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We are a consumer company in healthcare, not a healthcare
company,” says McNamara firmly. No prescriptions are required and his sector is
less tightly regulated than pharma.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The formula faces limits in countries where its pills are
familiar. Advil is the best-known US ibuprofen brand, but drugstore chains such
as Walgreens are shutting outlets and reducing stocks, and there are many
generics. Brand recognition is a powerful force, but two-thirds of Haleon’s
sales are in developed markets where it is hard to maintain excitement.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Novelty is easier in an Indian village discovering Sensodyne
for the first time, or in China, where Haleon has a marketing drive to reduce
osteoporosis with its Caltrate supplements. As the world tilts on its economic
axis, vitamins and toothpaste follow.</p><p class="MsoNormal">john.gapper@ft.com</p></body></html>
