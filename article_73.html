makes much of his fellow musicians’ accomplishments while making light of his
own. Trumpeter Terence Blanchard, he said, has composed more than 60 scores for
film and TV and James Genus has held the bass chair on the Saturday Night Live
band for 24 years.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hancock’s opening words introduced the keyboard program he
was toying with as “prehistoric predator” and then self-deprecatingly added
that he’d been performing for over 50 years. Yet it was Hancock’s musical
vision that shaped the evening, his energy that brought the audience to its
feet and his strength of character that let his musicians’ prodigious talents
fly.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hancock’s vast and varied catalogue spans 1960s acoustic
modernism and the avant-garde to world music, heavily amplified funk and
hip-hop. And he remains a forceful influence in the lineage of jazz piano. At
this gig, the first of three marking the pianist’s 85th birthday year, he
dipped into that huge back catalogue, referencing each strand and moulding them
anew into something contemporary and fresh.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The repertoire was familiar and the line-up unchanged from
his previous Barbican show in 2023. An “Overture” of what he described as bits
and pieces had solos for all, while condensing a large chunk of recent musical
history into a riveting kaleidoscope of styles. Once more, Wayne Shorter’s
“Footprints”, rearranged by Blanchard, and Hancock’s “Butterfly” followed. But
with rhythms shifting, a stronger jazz vibe and themes either stretched or
played as hints, it was more than the band’s improvisations that made this
performance unique.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hancock maintained the watery squelches, howls and jungle
noises of the “prehistoric predator” program for a while before the band eased
in with rattles, taps and a quiet bass drone. Blanchard’s trumpet, full-toned
and clear, signalled funky moves, backbeats rattled bones and the performance
was underway. Soon, blaxploitation riffs morphed into fine-tuned modern jazz,
solos reached crowd-raising highs and an unaccompanied Lionel Loueke conjured
an entire band using the pedals of his guitar. Thirty minutes later, and
playing without pause, the band stretched out on an up-tempo, straight-ahead
“Chameleon.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">As the night progressed, the rearranged “Footprints”
switched from playful bounce to night-time prowl and “Actual Proof” pulsated
with the youthful high-octane vigour of Jaylen Petinaud’s drumming — the
controlled virtuosity of the orchestrated solos he sprinkled through the set
were a highlight.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The piece is now a standard bearer of classic jazz funk, but
its roots lie in a seductive ballad that Hancock wrote for the score of the
racially conscious spy spoof, <i>The Spook Who Sat by the Door</i> (1973).</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Butterfly” followed, its theme stretched over a bed of
subtle funky beats, and then Hancock, half singing through a vocoder, noted
difficult times, the commonality of humankind and called for AI to be taught
ethical behaviour.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The segue into Loueke’s unaccompanied, jaw-dropping blend of
fugue, funk and Beninese roots was seamless.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The gig played out with a funky triptych of “Hang Up Your
Hangups”, “Spider” and “Rockit”, though once again, the band darted off at
tangents. A reprised and funky “Chameleon” was the closer, with Hancock on
keytar.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For more than two hours, Hancock and his band had delivered
dazzling solos, emotional focus and uncanny mutual rapport. Hancock’s place in
history as stylist and composer has long been assured. This concert confirmed
him as a bandleader of stature.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Touring to November, herbiehancock.com</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
