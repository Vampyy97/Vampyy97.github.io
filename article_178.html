uncertainty eases</h2><p class="MsoNormal">WILL SCHMITT AND ERIC PLATT<br/>
NEW YORK</p><p class="MsoNormal">US companies are taking advantage of blistering conditions
in the debt market to slash their borrowing costs, underscoring how many
investors are willing to back even risky deals as uncertainty over tariffs
eases.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Borrowers repriced more than $153bn of leveraged loans in
July as of Tuesday, eclipsing the previous record of $152.9bn set in December,
according to data from PitchBook LCD.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Leveraged loans are made to already heavily indebted
companies, often backed by private equity.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Companies’ moves to reprice their loans, typically under
existing facilities, come at a time when a strong rally across US markets has
pushed the premium investors demand to hold corporate debt lower.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The demand for corporate debt marks a comeback for a market
that sputtered in April when President Donald Trump’s so-called “liberation
day” tariff plans shook investor confidence.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“There is demand for risk assets and there has been no
supply,” said Lauren Basmadjian, Carlyle’s global head of liquid credit. “And
what happens with that backdrop, the market reprices.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Overall, borrowers were able to reduce their borrowing costs
by around 0.42 percentage points on average in July, according to PitchBook.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The reduction in yields echoes a shift for risky debt on the
secondary market. Leveraged loan spreads at 4.34 percentage points are below
the five-year average of 5.08 percentage points, according to data from
JPMorgan Chase and PitchBook LCD.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, the gap between yields on junk bonds and US
Treasuries recently has fallen to 2.82 percentage points from a high above 4.5
percentage points in April, Ice Data Services data shows.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Investors’ upbeat sentiment has also helped banks offload
debt offerings they were unable to sell just months ago. UBS and Citi last week
raised $1.9bn to finance private equity firm Patient Square Capital’s takeover
of Patterson Companies, a dental and veterinary health group, according to
people briefed on the matter.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The banks, along with a host of other lenders, had tried to
sell that debt in April but scrapped the deal because of the market volatility.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In Wall Street parlance, the debt was “hung” — meaning the
banks had to wire their own money to Patient Square instead of raising it from
traditional investors.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The banks have cleared the debt now but are still expecting
to take a loss on the deal, selling $500mn of secured notes with a 5.5 per cent
discount and offering about $1.4bn of term loans with a 10 per cent discount.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Private equity firm Vista Equity Partners also took
advantage of the rally, reviving plans to refinance about $3.6bn worth of debt
tied to Finastra, a financial technology company that it owns.</p><p class="MsoNormal">UBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Citi, Patient Square, Vista and Finastra declined to comment.</p></body></html>
