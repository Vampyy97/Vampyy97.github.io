have caused a sharp fall in the US pharmaceuticals group’s earnings, as the
company announced job losses as part of a wider restructuring in a bid to cut
costs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In results yesterday, Merck reported that after the effect
of currency fluctuations were stripped out, net income fell to $4.4bn in the
second quarter, down 17 per cent year on year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Merck had previously warned about the slump in sales of
Gardasil vaccines — which are used to prevent cervical cancers and other
conditions — saying in February that it was halting shipments to China to help
a key local supplier reduce excess inventory.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Additionally, Merck said a restructuring was under way to
save $3bn annually. This included an unspecified number of job cuts, though it
would continue to hire. The company said it would also shrink its real estate
holdings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Gardasil human papillomavirus virus vaccine remains
Merck’s second best-selling drug behind cancer treatment Keytruda. Global
Gardasil sales fell 55 per cent in the quarter to $1.1bn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Merck said that stripping out China Gardasil figures, its
total global sales would have increased 7 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sales of Keytruda, the world’s best-selling drug, rose 7 per
cent. The drug, whose patent expires in 2028, makes up more than half of
Merck’s sales.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The drugmaker maintained its full-year sales guidance of
$64.3bn-$65.3bn and affirmed a previous $200mn estimate of extra costs from new
US tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Its earnings per share after currency effects were stripped
out fell 16 per cent to $1.76, below analyst estimates. Shares were down more
than 3 per cent in late-morning trading.</p></body></html>
