JAMES FONTANELLA-KHAN — NEW YORK</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>A</i>rtificial intelligence start-up Anthropic is in
early talks to more than double its valuation to above $150bn in a new funding
round, giving it greater firepower to keep pace with rivals building advanced
AI models.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The competitor to Sam Altman’s OpenAI is in the preliminary
stages of funding discussions with investors and has received interest from
backers willing to value the business at more than $150bn, a huge jump from
Anthropic’s current $61.5bn price tag, according to four people with knowledge
of the matter.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Two of the people said final terms had not been fixed but
the four-year-old company was expected to raise at least $3bn, with one adding
that the round could reach up to $5bn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The start-up has spoken to large Middle Eastern investors
and received interest from MGX, Abu Dhabi’s vast AI investment fund, about
joining the new round, according to two of the people.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Anthropic has resisted raising money directly from the
Middle East, although another Abu Dhabi state fund linked to MGX purchased
almost $500mn of Anthropic shares from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX last year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a note to staff, chief executive Dario Amodei warned that
taking Middle East investment could “enrich dictators”. But he added:
“Unfortunately, I think ‘no bad person should ever benefit from our success’ is
a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.” Anthropic and MGX declined
to comment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The group is changing tack amid a fierce battle for funding
that has seen AI start-ups look beyond Silicon Valley to sovereign wealth
funds.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Anthropic is backed by Google and Amazon. The Financial
Times previously reported that Amazon has discussed plans for further
investment beyond its current $8bn commitment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Anthropic is racing OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Big Tech
rivals including Google and Meta to develop AI models capable of producing
text, code and images. Despite their rapid growth, neither Anthropic nor OpenAI
is close to being profitable, with both burning cash to pay for the huge amount
of computing power needed to train their models.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Additional reporting by Chloe Cornish in London</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
