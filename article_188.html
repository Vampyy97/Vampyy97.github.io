hold, for now, her plans for a proposed significant reduction in the cash Isa
limit (“Reeves puts cash Isa reforms on hold amid backlash from building
societies”, Report, July 11). This is money that building societies
recycle straight back into mortgage lending in the UK, supporting housing and
growth; it is not in any sense idle.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It always looked like a strange political choice, adopting a
position more in line with a Tory chancellor, Nigel Lawson, who introduced
Personal Equity Plans in his 1986 budget, rather than Gordon Brown, who evolved
them into Individual Savings Accounts in 1999, allowing for cash too, which is
what most people want for their hard-earned, after tax, savings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">About 40 per cent of people have a cash Isa; only
21 per cent have stocks and shares. Of course equity returns may well
be greater but many simply have no or a limited appetite for risking their
savings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Mark Bogard Chief Executive, The Family Building Society,
