are not novel (“The easy money trades lurking in the sustainable debt market”,
Moral Money, FT.com, July 18). A landmark case occurred three years ago, when
Poland’s state-controlled oil and gas company PKN Orlen and its
zloty-denominated linkers triggered a coupon “step-up” (an issuer penalty)
following an unexpected downgrade to its ESG rating. Yet bond prices remained
unresponsive to the step-up, and local investors seemed indifferent to what resembled
an “arbitrage” opportunity.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There is, indeed, an alpha opportunity in such instances,
but not necessarily a pure arbitrage. These trades are better suited to active,
institutional, long-only investors who can integrate them into their
portfolios. The canonical arbitrageur, referred to by Simon Mundy earlier in
his article and widely assumed to be omnipresent by proponents of efficient
markets, simply has no jurisdiction here.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Corporate credit investing is comparatively inefficient: it
requires upfront cash, offers limited leverage, and is not eminently liquid,
with wide bid-ask spreads due to its fragmented over-the-counter nature. For an
arbitrageur, any pricing anomaly must be sufficiently large to overcome these
frictions and to justify the cost of the capital tied up.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Moreover, such opportunities typically take time to converge
(“weeks”, per the article). This therefore requires arbitrageurs to warehouse
risk on their balance sheets for longer periods than they may be accustomed to,
additionally limiting their ability to redeploy capital across markets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Finally, there are often additional risk dimensions. In the
PKN Orlen case, for example, currency risk added another layer of complexity;
additional risks must either be hedged or absorbed, further deterring pure
arbitrageurs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hence, while sustainability-linked bonds may sometimes
exhibit pricing dislocations, it would be remiss to assume that sophisticated
arbitrageurs are simply overlooking them. These opportunities are best
understood as incremental yield, available to investors already underwriting
comparable underlying risks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hence, it is active, institutional, long-only asset managers
that are best positioned to harvest such mispricings when they align with their
core strategies.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Karim Henide<br/>
