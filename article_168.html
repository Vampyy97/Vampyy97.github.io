quarter as Europe’s largest lender took a charge on its stake in a Chinese bank
and racked up costs axing staff.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Pre-tax profits fell 29 per cent year on year to $6.3bn,
falling short of the almost $7bn forecast by analysts. Operating expenses,
which include severance costs linked to chief executive Georges Elhedery’s
sweeping restructuring, climbed 10 per cent to $8.9bn in the quarter.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The UK-based lender, which generates the bulk of its profits
in Asia, also recorded a $2.1bn impairment on its stake in China’s Bank of
Communications after the country’s finance ministry recapitalised the lender.
HSBC last year reported a $3bn charge on the value of its stake in the Chinese
bank.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Shares in HSBC fell 4.5 per cent in London on the news
yesterday, dragging down the wider FTSE 100 index.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Elhedery’s strategy since taking the top post last year
includes attempting to simplify the bank’s sprawling global operations and exit
businesses, such as banking in Canada and investment banking in the US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But HSBC has embarked on a restructuring as it also contends
with a prolonged property slump in Hong Kong and mainland China, adding to the
challenge for the new chief executive.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Elhedery yesterday struck a positive tone despite the weaker
than expected earnings. “We are well positioned for further growth with this
period of uncertainty highlighting our differentiated strength,” he said. “We
continue simplifying the bank... and we are progressing at pace with the exit
of non-strategic activities.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The bank added that it remained “on track” to achieve $1.5bn
in annualised cost savings by 2027.</p><p class="MsoNormal">HSBC did warn that profitability risked an indirect hit from
US President Donald Trump’s tariff regime in the coming years, saying it had
planned for multiple scenarios including a worst case that involves governments
slashing interest rates to as low as 1 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a sign of the threat posed by the downturn, the bank set
aside $1.1bn in the second quarter for bad loans, more than the $954mn analysts
had expected. The provision included $400mn of charges related to Hong Kong's
commercial real estate sector.</p><p class="MsoNormal">UK revenues were up quarter on quarter by 7 per cent to
$3.2bn and its lending balance increased by $7bn on a constant currency basis,
mainly in the UK. Like several of its rivals, HSBC has sought to expand its
wealth management business. Revenues at its international wealth and premier
banking business climbed 19 per cent in the first half of the year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Analysts at Citi said the second-quarter results were
“solid... supported by a very strong performance from wealth.” The bank also
announced a second interim dividend of 10 cents a share and a share buyback
plan of up to $3bn.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
