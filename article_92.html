industry</h2><p class="MsoNormal">Europe’s automakers face mounting problems. For over a
decade, an industry historically associated with technological and engineering
excellence has concealed less flattering truths about high costs and stagnating
output. Now faced with a trade conflict and accelerating Asian rivals, the
ability of Volkswagen and others to restructure is a litmus test for whether
European industry can remain globally relevant.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Our company embodies the challenge ahead. For too long we
have operated under the assumption that growth would offset rising costs and
under-utilised capacity. Fuelled by profits from China and strong sales of
premium brands such as Porsche and Audi, Volkswagen tried to grow its way out
of the problem instead of addressing structural inefficiencies. When demand
softened, the consequences became clear — declining margins, idle factories,
and fast-moving rivals first from the US and now China grabbing share on their
home turf.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But this is not just Volkswagen’s challenge. The auto
industry remains a pillar of Europe’s economy. According to McKinsey,
manufacturers, suppliers, finance providers and after-sale care services
together account for 7 per cent of Europe’s GDP and support nearly 14mn jobs
across the continent. The sector also drives wider growth: every euro invested
generates more than twice that in added value in the broader economic
landscape. The risks of decline go far beyond any single company.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Carmakers’ woes also reflect a deeper, long-term issue:
Europe’s widening productivity gap. Over the past 25 years, labour productivity
growth in the US has outpaced that of Europe by at least a percentage point on
average per year. Today, the consequences are stark. According to Goldman
Sachs, labour productivity per person employed in the US is, adjusted for
purchasing power, between 35 and 45 per cent higher than in France, Germany and
the UK — and the divide continues to grow.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Volkswagen Group is confronting these challenges head-on
with tough decisions. We have reduced production capacity by 750,000
automobiles in our German plants. We have limited wage growth. And we are
reducing our workforce by 35,000 in Germany alone by 2030 to boost productivity
both in terms of labour and capital. These steps are necessary in a world where
competitiveness is non-negotiable. At the same time, we are investing
decisively in the future, allocating €165bn over the next five years to drive electrification
and digitalisation while expanding into areas such as autonomous driving.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But one thing has become clear: investment alone is not
enough. Structural reform must come first — both at Volkswagen and in the EU.
Without changing how we work, build and organise, even the boldest investments
will fall short. Industrial competitiveness depends on core efficiency.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Priority reforms for the EU include more flexible labour
markets and smarter regulation that supports rather than stifles innovation. It
also means being pragmatic: securing access to critical raw materials and
adopting technology partnerships where speed matters more than
self-sufficiency. That’s why Volkswagen and others have entered tech-focused
joint ventures with partners in China and North America. The goal: to speed up
development of software, architecture and platforms — while scaling faster and
reducing costs, instead of building everything in-house.</p><p class="MsoNormal">All of this requires more ambition. Europe must become a
place where bold ideas are not just researched but industrialised and scaled up
across a common market. “Profit” should not be something we need to excuse. It
is the foundation for a sustainable business model and for securing jobs and
prosperity.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Draghi report on European competitiveness set the right
tone. But speed, nostalgia, and bold adaptation over complacency, performance
over rigid tradition — these must be guiding values.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To move forward, we must now choose structural reform over
complacency, performance over rigid tradition. The future of European industry
depends on it.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
