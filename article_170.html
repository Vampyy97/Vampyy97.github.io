quarter as strong trading revenue from volatile markets helped offset weakness
from its investment banking division.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Chief executive Sergio Ermotti reiterated his strong
opposition to stringent proposed capital requirements, calling them out of step
with global banking regulations. The Swiss parliament is due to start debating
the reforms in the autumn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Net profit at Switzerland’s largest bank came in higher than
the $2.2bn expected by analysts. Wealth management attracted $23bn in net new
assets, while the markets business had a record quarter with revenues of
$2.3bn, up 25 per cent year on year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">UBS’s strong trading revenues came against soft dealmaking
and capital markets activity. The bank said it expected trading activity to
normalise in the coming quarter, with steadier transaction volumes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Investor sentiment remains broadly constructive, tempered
by persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties,” UBS said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Our client conversations and deal pipelines indicate a high
level of readiness among investors and corporates to deploy capital, as
conviction around the macro outlook strengthens.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The bank also benefited from a $427mn release in legal
provisions related to a Credit Suisse case and a $577mn deferred tax benefit.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The integration with Credit Suisse, which it acquired in a
state-sponsored takeover in 2023, continues. UBS said it had saved $9.1bn in
costs through the tie-up and completed the migration of all Credit Suisse
client accounts outside Switzerland and about a third of Swiss client accounts.</p></body></html>
