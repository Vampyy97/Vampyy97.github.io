‘anti-democratic’</h2><p class="MsoNormal">The European Central Bank has been accused by members of its
own staff of behaving in an “anti-democratic” way, in an escalation of tensions
between the Eurozone’s monetary authority and its employees. In a letter to ECB
president Christine Lagarde, seen by the Financial Times, its staff committee
said the bank’s governance failed to respect the very rule-of-law principles
that she recently praised as one of Europe’s “critical comparative advantages.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We regret to see that these principles expressed outside
the institution seem to be given little value inside the institution by its
power structure,” wrote the chair of the staff committee, Carlos Bowles, to
Lagarde.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The letter was sent as the ECB has refused to back down in a
dispute over the Frankfurt institution’s works council, a group of elected
employees. The ECB has proposed forcing elected representatives to devote some
time to their day jobs. Under German labor law, they are able to focus
full-time on advocating for the best interests of staff while collecting their
normal salaries. However, as an extraterritorial institution, the ECB is
neither subject to German labor laws nor to similar rules in other EU member
states.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As such, the ECB was described as an “unaccountable legal
fortress,” Bowles stated in the letter. He argued that the ECB’s treatment of
staff had led to “widespread complaints of favoritism... high burnout rates and
the vulnerability of many colleagues working under temporary contracts.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The row is the latest sign of tense labor relations at the
central bank. In a survey of its employees conducted by the union Ipso this
year, 77 percent of the roughly 1,400 respondents said that “knowing the right
people” was key to getting ahead in the organization, compared with just 19
percent who believed that it did a good job of promoting “the most competent
people.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Bowles said in the letter that the ECB “is both in a
situation of being an employer and a legislator,” leaving staff in a position
that threatened their freedom to “independently express their expert views.”
The ECB was using its power to “undermine and even silence the only
institutional counterweight within the ECB, namely the staff representation.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The ECB responded: “We are firmly committed to the rule of
law and operate within a clear employment framework that is closely aligned
with EU staff regulations and is subject to European Court of Justice
scrutiny,” adding that it had won “the overwhelming majority of court cases
before the European Court of Justice on the ECB employment law framework.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The ECB has claimed its proposed changes to employee
representatives’ roles, which it wants to implement by mid-2026, would be in
the interests of all staff. It says the rules would ensure staff
representatives could “pursue their career path and stay closely connected to
the ongoing work and public mandate” of the bank, while advocating for staff
needs at the same time.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The heads of Europe’s services sector union Epsu and German
union Verdi also wrote to Lagarde this year, urging her to abandon the proposed
changes. Legal privileges and protection of works councils have been enshrined
in German law for more than a century.</p></body></html>
