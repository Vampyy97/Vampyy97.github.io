products by about 5 per cent in the US this year, as the consumer goods giant
seeks to offset a $1bn cost hit from tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">US President Donald Trump’s levies have raised costs for raw
materials, packaging and goods sold by P&amp;G, which makes Gillette razors,
Dawn dish soap and other household products. Andre Schulten, chief financial
officer, said yesterday that the company would increase prices by a “mid-single
digit” percentage in the new fiscal year on about a quarter of the items
P&amp;G sells in the US. Higher prices will come in part from product
innovations, such as recently improved varieties of Luvs nappies and Tide
detergent, he added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We have invested significantly in the US to localise
production close to our consumer,” he said. “But there are some materials,
ingredients, packaging that are not available in the US, so those are imported
from other markets and are subject to tariffs. Also, our exports of products
that are manufactured in the US to Canada are also subject to tariffs,”
Schulten added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">P&amp;G’s markets were getting tougher in the US and in
Europe, with consumers who are “clearly more selective”, he said, adding that
shoppers were looking for value by buying in bulk or in smaller packs in venues
such as dollar stores.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company reported net sales of $20.9bn in the quarter to
June, rising 2 per cent on the same period last year and surpassing
expectations of $20.8bn, according to analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Net
income of $3.6bn also beat market forecasts. P&amp;G shares rose 2 per cent in
early trading yesterday before falling back.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Organic sales, which strip out the effects of foreign
exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, rose 2 per cent in the quarter
thanks to higher pricing and the mix of products sold. P&amp;G highlighted a 4
per cent rise in prices for its grooming segment, where sales were “driven by
innovation-based pricing”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The expected cost of the tariffs, which will be an estimated
$800mn after tax, amounts to more than 1 per cent of P&amp;G’s net sales of
$84.3bn in the fiscal year that ended in June. P&amp;G forecast organic sales
to rise in a range from unchanged to up to 4 per cent in the current fiscal
year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">On Monday, P&amp;G announced that Jon Moeller would retire
as chief executive at the end of 2025 to be replaced by Shailesh Jejurikar,
chief operating officer.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
