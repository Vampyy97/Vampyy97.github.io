last Thursday that the US’s biggest railway had made significant progress in
talks on merging with another network, he used deceptively humdrum language.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company was “in advanced talks” with Norfolk Southern,
the US’s fourth-biggest railway, about a “potential business combination”, he
told participants in the company’s second-quarter results conference call.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet to observers and analysts of freight railways in the US
and Canada, Union Pacific’s plans are far more than just another “business
combination”. A successful deal would destroy the widespread assumption that
big Canadian and US railways — which handle about 40 per cent of intercity
freight movements — had become so consolidated that regulators would block any
new attempted merger.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A $200bn combination of Union Pacific — which operates west
of the Mississippi — and Norfolk Southern, on the east, would be the first
operator in US railways’ 200-year history able to carry goods all the way from
the Pacific coast to the Atlantic on its own tracks.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal could prompt BNSF, the other big western railway,
owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, to consider a tie-up with CSX,
the other big network in the east, according to many analysts.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Tony Hatch, an independent analyst, said the talks had
surprised an industry that stopped expecting new deals after Canadian Pacific
bought Kansas City Southern in 2023. “The thinking was that this would be the
last merger,” Hatch said. “All of a sudden, there’s been a revival of
interest.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Henry Posner, a veteran rail investor and chair of the Iowa
Interstate Railroad, said there could still be considerable opposition from
customers to the creation of a behemoth with the power that a transcontinental
railway would wield. “At the industry level, it’s hard to imagine a
constituency that’s anxious to see a transcontinental railroad merger,” he
said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The big question is whether industry regulator the Surface
Transportation Board has changed sufficiently under US President Donald Trump
to brush aside precedent and clear a deal.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Another question is whether it would approve a “voting
trust”, a key mechanism that in past US rail mergers has allowed shareholders
in a target company to sell up and avoid the risks of the STB’s laborious
approval process, which typically takes at least 18 months.</p><p class="MsoNormal">At a conference in May, Keith Creel, chief executive of the
merged Canadian Pacific Kansas City, pointed out that any new deal would take
place under tough rules introduced in 2001 that required any transaction to
“enhance competition”. Those rules did not apply to the 2023 deal because
Kansas City Southern had an exemption.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“There is... not a hill of regulatory risk to climb,” Creel
said. “There’s mountains of regulatory risk.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, Union Pacific’s advisers appear confident a
deal is possible. Vena has used language apparently calculated to appeal to
Trump's economic nationalism. In an interview with industry magazine Trains,
published in May before the Norfolk Southern talks became public, Vena said: “I
think it’s a win for our customers and a win for competition, and it’s a win
for how the country should move ahead.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Advocates for a merger have argued that creation of a single
transcontinental railway would improve the industry’s structure. There are two
big western networks, two big networks in the east, and CPKC and Canadian
National competing in Canada and parts of the US. Long-distance freight often
has to be handed over between operators, frequently in Chicago, which becomes
congested at busy times.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hatch said there was also potential for a merged rail
network to make a better job of handling “watershed” traffic from the areas
near the Mississippi that needed to go relatively short distances.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet even if it approves a merger, the STB could still demand
in return that a network sell some of its routes to a rival or allow another
operator to use parts of its track.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hatch pointed out in a note to clients this week that any
merger might face opposition from large customers worried that a merged network
would enjoy far more power to raise prices.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Posner, who sits on a committee advising the STB on
passenger rail issues, insisted there was no certainty the regulator would bend
with the political wind. The board has a Republican chair but only one other
Republican member, alongside two Democrats and a vacant seat. “I think the STB
is somewhat removed from political pressure,” Posner said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">On top of the approval concerns, there is a strong chance
the regulator might bar the use of a “voting trust”. In past rail mergers,
shareholders in the selling company have sold their shares to an independent
entity which has overseen the railroad’s operations during the 18 months to two
years that the STB takes to consider a deal.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Canadian National failed in a counterbid to Canadian
Pacific’s offer for Kansas City Southern, partly because the regulator barred
it from using a voting trust. Hatch said that, without the trust structure,
shareholders would face an unattractive period of uncertainty.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It remains possible, according to analysts, that Union
Pacific will navigate the many challenges and succeed in its bid to reshape US
freight rail’s competitive landscape.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet Hatch stressed that there remained considerable
uncertainties. “We've long thought that the risk and the cost would overwhelm
the benefits,” Hatch said of a potential deal. “It appears that Union Pacific
now think they have a handle on that and they can pull off enough benefit to
make the risks worth it.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
