deals. With the stick of losing access to America’s vast market and the carrot
of negotiating down his hefty April 2 tariff threats ahead of an impending
August 1 deadline, the US president has compelled nations including the UK,
Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam to yield to his terms. The EU,
with its economic heft and leverage as a net importer of US services, had one
of the better shots at finding a middle ground. Instead it, too, capitulated.</p><p class="MsoNormal">On Sunday, Trump and European Commission president Ursula
von der Leyen struck a deal that imposes US tariffs of 15 per cent on most
imports from the bloc, including cars, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. US
imports slightly less uncertainty. The US president had threatened 30 per cent
duties on the EU if no deal was struck by August 1. Another consolation was an
agreement on zero-for-zero tariffs covering €70bn of trade.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The bloc has struggled to coordinate its negotiations and
potential retaliation across its 27 member states. There remains confusion on
what products are covered by the deal. On Tuesday, France was seeking clarity
on exemptions for wine and spirits. US officials have said no such carve-outs
are in the offing. With his deadline for negotiations due tomorrow, more than
60 per cent of US imports threatened with “reciprocal tariffs” are now covered
by Trump’s deals. The president clearly has a winning formula for getting his
way. First, make shocking demands to stoke panic. Then pull back for
time-limited negotiations. Having a mix of economically vulnerable,
retaliation-shy, and pliable trade partners helps. Finally, strike an agreement
below the initial threat level, and sell the result as a win-win.</p><p class="MsoNormal">That the April 2 “reciprocal” tariff package has been
whittled down is only a small relative positive. The world’s largest economy’s
effective tariff rate is still at a 90-year high, and will rise further if
Trump imposes full reciprocal tariffs on nations that fail to strike deals with
him by tomorrow. Existing inventories, tariff front-running and the absorption
of higher duties by businesses have, for now, dulled the near-term impact of
Trump's protectionist agenda. Despite raising its near-term growth forecasts on
Tuesday, the IMF said trade uncertainty meant global economic risks were skewed
to the downside. Indeed, assuming Trump’s plans aren’t diluted or postponed
again, the hit from higher trading frictions to the international and American
economy will become more noticeable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Either way, Trump’s deals are not set in stone. With his
belligerent negotiating style, the US president has subverted the rules-based
trading system by usurping historic trade agreements and undermining the most
favoured nation principle of free trade. The deals he has struck are likely to
remain open-ended. The White House is also readying sector-specific tariffs,
which will heap more costs on key industries.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump has ushered in an era in which panic rather than
policy drives the global trading system. Those negotiating with his
administration say striking deals is about pragmatism. But for those that ought
to be able to push back, such as the EU, it has looked more like cowering to a
bully. The world’s largest trading bloc may have dodged higher tariffs, but it
has also rubber-stamped the US president’s new world order.</p></body></html>
