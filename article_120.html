YORK</p><p class="MsoNormal">Oil and gas equipment supplier Baker Hughes has clinched a
$13.6bn all-cash deal to buy Chart Industries, gatecrashing an earlier
agreement to merge with rival Flowserve.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The acquisition gives Baker Hughes, the $46bn oilfield
services group, a stronger foothold serving crucial industries such as
liquefied natural gas, nuclear energy and data centres and helps to boost its
fast-growing industrial and energy technology division.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal to buy Chart, which specialises in handling gas and
liquids at extremely low temperatures mainly for industrial clients, displaces
an agreement the company made earlier this year with rival Flowserve to combine
in a $19bn all-stock merger. That agreement, which was framed as a merger of
equals, will be terminated as a result.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal values Chart’s equity at $210 a share, a 22 per
cent premium to its market capitalisation, giving it an equity value of about
$10bn, Baker Hughes said yesterday, confirming an earlier report in the
Financial Times.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Shares in Chart jumped 16.7 per cent to just above $200 in
pre-market trading on the announcement.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive and chair of Baker
Hughes, told the FT a key rationale for the deal was that it directed the
company further towards high-growth sectors of the economy, such as the rollout
of data centres, hydrogen and carbon capture storage, for the next decade.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“When you think about the macro trends that are happening
around the world, when it comes to data centres, when it comes to
electrification, when it comes to decarbonisation ... all of these capabilities
are now within Baker Hughes with the successful closing of the Chart Industries
acquisition,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The deal would yield a margin boost and $325mn in annual
cost synergies after three years, the company said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Analysts project that Baker Hughes’ industrial and energy
technology division will generate about 47 per cent of its nearly $27.1bn total
revenues this year, up from 37.1 per cent five years ago, according to
Bloomberg.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
