DANIEL THOMAS — LONDON</p><p class="MsoNormal">Spotify swung to a net loss in the second quarter as the
music streaming group had been “moving too slowly” on advertising, boss Daniel
Ek said, sending shares down 11 per cent in New York late-morning trading
yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company reported a net loss of €86mn for the three
months to the end of June, or €0.42 a share, down from a profit of €274mn in
the same period last year — far below analysts’ expectations and following
higher costs related to staff pay.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ek said: “The one area that hasn't yet beaten expectations
is our ads business ... We have simply been moving too slowly,” adding it was
“really an execution challenge, not a problem with the strategy.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Spotify, which has been introducing automated tools for
companies to buy ads on its site, reported a 1 per cent fall in advertising
revenues year on year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The music streaming platform reported €4.2bn in revenue in
the second quarter, up 10 per cent year on year but lower than its guidance,
due to currency movements.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It said it was expecting operating income of €485mn in the
third quarter and revenue of €4.2bn, both below expectations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“As you look at the underlying fundamentals of the business,
this year is largely playing out as expected,” Ek added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The company’s shares have risen by 53 per cent in the year
to date, following a cost-cutting push that led to its first-ever full year of
profit in 2024.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Investors have been closely watching profitability after the
group started to raise subscription prices, bring in new tiers and add to its
services in audiobooks and podcasts.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Spotify in June raised prices in France, confirming an FT
report that it was planning to increase prices in dozens of countries.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Subscribers climbed 12 per cent to 276mn, while monthly
active users grew 11 per cent to 696mn.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
