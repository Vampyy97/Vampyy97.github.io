sanctions</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Steff Chavez — New York, Christopher Miller — Kyiv,

days to agree a ceasefire in Ukraine or face tighter sanctions, as his
frustration with his Russian counterpart escalates.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Speaking at his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland yesterday,
the US president said he would bring forward the 50-day deadline he previously
set Vladimir Putin to avoid so-called secondary sanctions. “I’m going to reduce
that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number,” said Trump. “I’m going to
make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“There’s no reason in waiting,” he added in a joint
appearance with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. “I want to be generous, but
we just don't see any progress being made.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump on July 14 threatened Moscow with “severe” tariffs and
secondary sanctions against countries that buy Russian oil, if Putin does not
reach a truce with Ukraine.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US president signalled yesterday he does not believe
Putin will comply within the original 50-day window. “I think I already know
the answer, what is going to happen,” he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump added that he would confirm the new deadline last
night or today, describing himself as “very disappointed” with the Russian
president. “I’m not so interested in talking [to Putin] any more,” he said. “He
talks. We have such nice conversations... and then people die the following
night in a missile” strike. “Every time I think it’s going to end, he kills
people.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">While Trump spent the early months of his presidency blaming
the conflict on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his tone has shifted
recently, particularly since the US and Ukrainian presidents met during the
Nato summit just over a month ago.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Kremlin did not have an immediate response to Trump’s
new ultimatum, but before his comments on the shorter ceasefire deadline,
Russian officials were continuing to insist Moscow was open to talks. “We are
open to dialogue. President Putin has repeatedly spoken about this, with any
other country, including European ones,” foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said
yesterday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, said a Trump-Putin
meeting was possible during the Russian president's visit to China in
September, but so far no specific preparations were under way.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Andriy
Yermak, welcomed Trump’s decision to bring forward the ceasefire deadline,
thanking him for “standing firm and delivering a clear message of peace through
strength.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Russia in recent months has increasingly used “swarm”
tactics in its drone attacks against Ukraine, cutting through Kyiv’s air
defences at the highest rate since Putin’s full-scale invasion began in
February 2022.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump's shift in position also comes as Russian forces
intensify their ground offensive across the 1,200km front line in eastern
Ukraine, advancing at the fastest rate in a year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Zelenskyy, who spoke with Trump on July 4 and welcomed his
special envoy, Keith Kellogg, to Kyiv the following week, has urged Washington
to step up economic sanctions on Russia to help suppress its war machine.
Washington can cut individuals and countries off from the global economy via
its far-reaching sanctions programme.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The White House has said that if Russia refuses to agree to
a ceasefire, it “will face very steep tariffs,” and Washington would apply
secondary sanctions to countries purchasing oil from Moscow. “That will do deep
damage to Russia’s economy,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said
this month.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Additional reporting by Lauren Fedor</i></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
