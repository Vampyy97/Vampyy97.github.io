goods</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Laura Dubois — Brussels</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">Brussels has accused Chinese ecommerce group Temu of
breaching the bloc’s landmark digital rules by failing to do enough to prevent
the sale of illegal products on its platform.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In preliminary findings published yesterday, the European
Commission said its probe had revealed “a high risk” of EU consumers
encountering illegal products on Temu's site. It also said the results of a
mystery shopping exercise had found products that breached EU rules on the
marketplace, including baby toys and small electronics.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Brussels launched its investigation into Temu last year
under the bloc’s Digital Services Act, asking the online retailer for
information about its actions to restrict sales of illegal items “as well as
risks relating to consumer protection, public health and users’ wellbeing.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The EU legislation puts online platforms under greater
pressure to police their sites more aggressively.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The commission found that a risk assessment submitted by
Temu relating to the sale of illegal products on its site was “inaccurate”, and
relied on general industry information rather than specific details about its
marketplace. The commission said that might have led to “inadequate mitigation
measures” against the spread of illegal products.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Temu is a priority for us. The problems caused on the
European market by non-compliant products coming from online marketplaces are
an issue,” said a commission official.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The findings come as the bloc seeks to make ecommerce
platforms liable for dangerous or illegal products sold online. The commission
in June accused rival Chinese online marketplace AliExpress of not doing enough
to prevent the dissemination of counterfeit goods or unsafe products. It
launched an investigation into Shein, on consumer protection concerns, earlier
this year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The EU also plans to levy a flat fee of €2 on billions of
small packages entering the bloc, mainly from China, in a fresh blow to Temu
and Shein.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Temu has several weeks to respond to the inquiry’s findings,
and could face a fine of up to 6 per cent of its global annual revenue if it is
found in breach of rules. Brussels is also looking at Temu’s alleged use of
“addictive design features,” how products are recommended on the site, and
access to data, as part of the wider probe.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
