outpacing its rivals in a difficult luxury market as wealthy shoppers continued
to shell out for its high-end bags.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Paris-based luxury house yesterday reported sales of
€3.9bn, a 9 per cent rise on the same period last year at constant exchange
rates, and ahead of analyst forecasts. Operating income rose 6 per cent in the
first half of the year to €3.3bn, beating expectations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This year Hermès overtook LVMH to become the world’s most
valuable luxury company by market capitalisation for the first time. But,
despite relatively strong results, shares in Hermès fell 4.5 per cent. That
trimmed their rise over the past year to 12 per cent, giving the company a
market capitalisation of €243bn — just ahead of LVMH.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Bernstein analyst Luca Solca noted that weaker performance
at some of Hermès’ smaller divisions was a sign the luxury sector remained
under pressure.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hermès said it would offset the impact of higher US tariffs
by raising prices in the country. But executive chair Axel Dumas said he did
not anticipate raising prices again after increasing them globally in May,
including by an additional 5 per cent in the US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Demand for Kelly and Birkin handbags drove organic growth of
12 per cent in Hermès’ leather goods division in the first half of the year.
Sales in the fashion and silk divisions rose 6 and 4 per cent respectively,
though revenues in its watchmaking unit fell in the period.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hermès reported sales in the Americas rose 12.3 per cent in
the second quarter, well ahead of analyst expectations, despite the price rise
in the spring. Sales in Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, rose 3 per cent despite
a slowdown in Chinese spending on luxury more broadly.</p></body></html>
