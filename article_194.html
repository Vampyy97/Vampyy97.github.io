starts to slow</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" height="478" src="FT_files/image094.png" width="361"/></p><p class="MsoNormal">One of the big themes in the energy sector is that oil is no
longer a growth market. Demand for the fuel, the bulk of which is consumed in
transport, is sluggish. Former growth engines such as China are being throttled
by the rapid rollout of electric vehicles, and there is spare capacity sitting
on the sidelines.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hence the growing focus, among companies that provide
metaphorical picks and shovels to energy producers, on liquefied natural gas.
The supercooled fuel is one of the fastest-growing areas in energy as
electricity demand booms and countries seek to transition out of coal. Baker
Hughes’ $13.6bn swoop on Chart Industries is a bet on this commodity’s future.</p><p class="MsoNormal">That drillers need to build a strategic alternative to their
traditional oil business is clear. According to the International Energy
Agency, global oil investments are expected to drop 6 per cent this year.
Shares in big oil services groups Halliburton and SLB are down 33 per cent and
24 per cent respectively over the past 12 months.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Baker Hughes has managed to buck the trend; its stock is up
a fifth thanks to its pivot to LNG. Its “gas technology” segment now makes up
more than a third of group revenue and is its fastest growing division, with
sales up 7 per cent in the quarter ending in June.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Buying Chart, which generated $4.1bn in revenue last year
from the sales of equipment such as cryogenic tanks and cooling systems, will
bolster Baker Hughes’ position in the LNG service sector and in new markets
such as data centres, new energy and more.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This empire building does not come cheap. Chart had said in
June that it would merge with fellow industrial group Flowserve. Gatecrashing
the deal meant Baker Hughes had to offer a 22 per cent premium to Chart’s
closing price on Monday and an 82 per cent premium to where the stock was
trading less than four months ago.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet that is not an insurmountable obstacle. Baker Hughes
expects to cut $325mn of costs that, taxed and capitalised, exceed the value of
the 22 per cent premium it is paying. And its offer puts Chart’s enterprise
value at 11 times forward ebitda, similar to where Flowserve is trading.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The biggest risk is timing. LNG is growing, but it has also
already attracted a lot of investment. Between 2026 and 2028, the global LNG
market is set to experience its largest ever capacity growth, says the IEA.
That could push prices lower and prompt groups to slow investment. In an
industry that is not unfamiliar with boom and bust cycles, Baker Hughes will be
hoping it has timed its bet well.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
