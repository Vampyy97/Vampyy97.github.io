do,” says the head of Cyprus’s farmers’ union. “We're hoping for clouds, for
rain.” But as their island enters a third consecutive year of drought, there is
little sign of either.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This summer, for the first time in recent memory, Cyprus
will be forced to import tomatoes, watermelons and other produce it has long
grown, because farmers cannot irrigate. The government has halved agricultural
water allocations, cutting off seasonal crops entirely. “We’ve accepted it,”
Papapetrou says. “But let’s not pretend this is just a farmers’ problem. It
affects the whole country. Prices will soar.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">As climate change makes rains more erratic and groundwater
sources run low, governments across the world are seeking solutions to keep the
taps running — a boon for the fast-growing desalination industry, which market
researchers think will exceed $20bn in 2027. In 2024, it was estimated at less
than $15bn.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In Cyprus, years of under-investment, fragmented
policymaking and reliance on rainfall have brought the water system close to
collapse. As of early June, the country’s 18 main reservoirs were just 21.7 per
cent full. Five years ago, that figure was 97 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Doubling down on energy-intensive desalination is now seen
as the only viable option. Cyprus already has four large-scale desalination
plants that it operates during water scarcity. Maria Panayiotou, the country’s
agriculture minister, has made desalination the centrepiece of a 28-point
emergency water plan, aiming to meet all of Cyprus’s drinking water needs
through desalination within two to three years by operating the units
continuously.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The southern European state is just one country in a
widening water-stressed zone, loosely encircling the globe from India across to
North America, with parts of the Pacific and southern Africa also affected. An
estimated one in 10 people now lives in a country with what the UN’s water
agency classifies as “high and critical water stress.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">As populations and economies grow, “societies are becoming
thirstier and thirstier”, says Kaveh Madani, director of the UN University
Institute for Water, Environment and Health. “We have limited renewable water
supplies that are now becoming even more limited than before thanks to climate
change.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">‘Now we're even thinking about desalinating and transferring
water for 800km. This is how desperate people are.’</p><p class="MsoNormal">The desalination process has improved drastically in recent
decades, finally pulling away from the ancient technique of boiling seawater to
more sophisticated technology, reverse osmosis, that uses microscopic pores in
specially designed membranes to filter out salt. Professor Nidal Hilal,
director of the Water Research Center at New York University Abu Dhabi,
estimates that global growth in desalination capacity is between 6 and 12 per
cent annually.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But both the older thermal technique and the newer version
have the same problems: they require large amounts of energy to power the
plants, and the process produces pollution in the form of ultra salty water.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Now, with demand rising, companies and governments from the
Middle East and beyond are ploughing billions into scaling up the desalination
infrastructure needed in a warmer, drier world, while wrestling with the
technology’s unpalatable side-effects. “It produces a lot of brine. It affects
the ecosystem. Significantly,” says Madani.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet for some countries, desalination is the only answer.
“Now we're even thinking about desalinating and transferring water ... like
transferring water for 800km,” he adds. “It sounds crazy, but this is how
desperate people are.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The driving force behind desalination’s modernisation are
the communities around the Gulf, whose existence depends on the process. The
oil-rich Gulf state of Kuwait, which has no permanent rivers and was once
forced to ship freshwater in from neighbouring Iraq, pioneered the technology
in the Middle East by commissioning its first desalination plant in 1951.
Similarly parched neighbours quickly followed suit. Today the arid Middle East
and North Africa region accounts for about 70 per cent of global desalination
capacity, according to the EU Blue Economy Observatory. The region’s largest
plants can produce enough water to supply more than 1 million people.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Below the undulating surface of the Arabian Sea, thousands
of cubic metres of water flow into pipes tall enough for a person to stand up
in, running over a kilometre back to Oman’s biggest desalination plant, Barka
IV, which uses reverse osmosis. Getting the seawater into the plant is
difficult. It has to be siphoned gently, to avoid drawing in sea creatures. A
wall of bubbles billows around the intake pipes to ward off jellyfish.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The salty water that flows into tanks is green with algae,
which must be pushed to the surface using air bubbles, creating a sludgy carpet
that can be skimmed off before filtration.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This pre-treatment must be completed before the water is
pushed at high pressure through delicate membranes. After that, minerals are
added to the pure water. The leftover super-salty brine is diffused back into
the sea.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The sea in the Gulf is “the hardest water to desalinate on
the planet,” according to Hilal of NYU Abu Dhabi. The semi-enclosed Gulf is
much saltier than larger, more open bodies of water. And “the higher the salt
concentration, the more energy is required for desalination,” Hilal says,
adding that the situation is aggravated by the water's high “turbidity” or
cloudiness, due to the sea’s shipping routes and the presence of wastewater.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A typical desalination plant process</p><p class="MsoNormal">Reverse osmosis — if pressure is applied to the solution,
the flow can be forced to reverse; this is useful in desalination.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sources: Tampa Bay Water</p><p class="MsoNormal">The industry has attempted to reduce energy consumption by
switching to reverse osmosis, like at Barka IV, which is far less intensive.
“It’s around a fourth, or a fifth even, of the energy required for the thermal
desalination technology,” explains Hilal. “The membrane technology has
developed a lot and we are still, in my opinion, on the surface of it.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Reducing energy consumption has made producing desalinated
water less polluting in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced the
costs. In Israel, water produced by the Sorek B desalination plant is priced at
about 40 cents per cubic metre, which is enough for 25 showers, according to
Thames Water. Dubai utility Dewa will get a price of 37 cents per cubic metre
for water from its Hassyan desalination plant, which is due to start operations
next year.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We've put a lot of money in R&amp;D... to be able to reduce
this energy consumption," says Estelle Brachlianoff, chief executive
officer of energy and water company Veolia. “We've divided [the cost] by five
in the last 12 years.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The €22.4bn French multinational is one of the utility and
engineering companies profiting from the world’s increasing water fragility.
The company says 18 per cent of global desalination capacity already runs on
its technology.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Academic researchers are focusing on improving the membranes
by looking for materials and techniques to prevent them getting clogged up with
residue, which shortens their lifespans.</p><p class="MsoNormal">And there are hopes reverse osmosis desalination can be made
even more energy efficient. In the US, so-called deep-sea desalination is being
piloted, using the pressure of the ocean itself to push seawater through the
membranes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But the benefits of cheaper desalination are not enjoyed by
all. Cyprus is using reverse osmosis but imports fossil fuels to power it,
meaning each cubic metre costs €1.50 to produce — almost five times as much as
the new Hassyan plant in Dubai.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The government plans to retrofit pumping stations with solar
panels, but space on the island is limited and its grid lacks the storage
capacity to support more water.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Seawater is drawn in...<br/>
passes through a series of filtration and chemical stages, removing larger
particles ...<br/>
and is pumped at pressure through reverse osmosis membranes ...<br/>
Separating it into freshwater ...<br/>
and highly salinated saltwater<br/>
In some cases the saltwater can be mixed with cooling water leaving a power
plant, lowering salinity and returning it to environmentally acceptable levels</p><p class="MsoNormal">Reverse osmosis - If a pressure is applied to the solution,
the flow can be forced to reverse, this is useful in desalination.<br/>

Hadjigeorgiou, former head of the water development department, says. “It needs
reliable power.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Gulf is still reliant on the older technology, which has
a long lifespan. Dubai, the Arab Gulf’s second-biggest city by population after
Riyadh, gets 86 per cent of its desalinated water from thermal distillation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Companies in the region say they want to change this. Taga,
the Abu Dhabi utilities company that provides the city with desalinated water,
aims to have 66 per cent of its desalination capacity use reverse osmosis by
2030, up from 40 per cent today. It has also added 70 megawatts of solar power
to its vast Taweelah plant, which uses reverse osmosis, to reduce its use of
fossil fuels.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“It’s a priority for us that we be more efficient,” says
Taqa’s chief executive, Jasim Husain Thabet. “Therefore we are rolling out more
reverse osmosis” and eyeing other initiatives including reusing wastewater and
curbing losses from leaking pipes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Even as emissions from desalination fall, there is the
intractable problem of brine, the ultra-salty substance left behind after pure
water is extracted.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Desalination worldwide produces 150 million cubic metres of
brine per day, according to scientific research. This thick, milky liquid is
generally dumped back into the sea. One study has linked desalination brine
with coral bleaching in the Gulf of Aqaba and others have found impacts on
marine life on the sea bed around discharge points.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Cyprus is particularly worried about brine’s impact on the
Mediterranean.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“For every cubic metre of freshwater, nearly half a cubic
metre of brine is discharged,” says Hadjigeorgiou. The island uses offshore
pipelines and diffusers to spread the brine up to 2km from the coast, away from
sensitive ecosystems, and “there’s no evidence of damage so far, but we must
stay vigilant,” she says.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the small, shallow Gulf, which feeds more than 800
desalination plants, jettisoning brine has led to concerns about rising salt
concentration and the impact on sensitive species.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“There are challenges with brine discharge,” acknowledges
Taqa’s Thabet. “It’s not limited to us, it is an industry-wide problem that
needs a collective action.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Academics in Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest desalinated
water producer, are trying to tackle the brine problem. Zhiping Lai, a
professor at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, is mining
the brine for valuable elements. His team has published in the journal <i>Science</i> a
novel method for extracting lithium, which is used in making batteries, and Lai
has established a start-up to try to commercialise the new technique.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“In principle if we could extract lithium from this brine,
it could enhance economic viability to solve this issue,” says Lai. Although
lithium is found in very low concentrations in brine, “the kingdom is willing
to spend efforts to solve this challenge.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">With desalination such a high priority in the Gulf, Veolia
boss Brachlianoff says governments there have found successful models for
contracting and financing the projects. These are usually private-public
partnerships with “specific financing, specific take or pay models from the
customer”. She highlighted the UAE, which has awarded three projects to Veolia
in recent years, all through private-public partnership models.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Veolia says the Middle East market was its fastest growing
last year across its different services. “Water technologies is one of its
fastest-growing services worldwide, with reported sales of nearly €5bn last
year.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Middle East “was always aware that water was something
absolutely needed for industry. So we have desalination plants to serve
refineries in the Middle East, not only to serve the population or to serve
industries,” says Brachlianoff. “This realisation that you need water for
everything, of course, [is one on] which Europe is quite behind.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Veolia has plenty of multinational competitors. Spain’s
Acciona, whose water division had 2024 revenues of €1.2bn, has contracts to run
desalination plants from Perth, Australia, to Qatar and a market capitalisation
of €9.3bn. South Korea’s Doosan Enerbility also operates desalination
facilities across the Gulf.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Middle Eastern infrastructure builders are also looking to
export their desalination expertise. Riyadh-listed ACWA Power is the region’s
biggest power and water developer. It says it controls more than a quarter of
the desalinated water in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman and Bahrain. “We are now
looking abroad [beyond the Gulf],” says Marco Arcelli, chief executive. “We
hope to be signing soon agreements in Azerbaijan, Senegal. We're looking at
projects in China, in Malaysia, in the Philippines.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Yet some experts warn that desalination, while profitable
for companies, is far from the sole solution to water shortages. Countries are
also investing in improving water infrastructure.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The European Investment Bank, for example, lent some €400m
to water projects in Spain last year, which paid for the renovation or
installation of 2,000km worth of pipes. Between 2023 and 2024, the
drought-affected state of California spent $63m on water recycling, capture and
storage projects.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We have the commercial system and we have the desperate
governments on the other side,” says Madani, the UN University official. “It’s
much easier to increase supply than cut consumption.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">He adds that reducing water use and harnessing wastewater
are also critical. “Desalination can play and will play a major role… But it’s
not the solution. That means building the biggest desalination plant in your
country is not necessarily something to celebrate.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Graphic illustration by Ian Bott</i></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
