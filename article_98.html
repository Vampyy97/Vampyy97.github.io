peacekeeping efforts to Sudan at a Washington summit with the foreign ministers
of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and UAE today where they hope to hammer out a joint
position on the devastating two-year-old conflict.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Tens of thousands of people have been killed and 13mn
displaced since war erupted in April 2023 after a tussle for power between two
military factions, the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support
Forces.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US rejected a last-minute request by Egypt for
representatives of Sudan's government, the SAF, to attend the summit, which is
due to be chaired by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, said people briefed on
the talks. The state department declined to comment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Cameron Hudson, senior fellow at the Washington-based Center
for Strategic and International Studies, said US peace efforts under Trump were
characterised by what he called a pattern of "fly by the seat of the
pants-style diplomacy". There was "minimal preparation" and a
hope that "just getting people in a room is sufficient", he said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The push in Sudan follows so far unsuccessful attempts to
resolve conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. But the Trump administration did broker
a tentative peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda at a
meeting in Washington last month, led by Massad Boulos, Trump's main Africa
adviser and the father-in-law of his daughter, Tiffany. Trump hailed the
agreement as a reason he should be awarded the Nobel peace prize.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The summit will not be the first international effort to
negotiate peace in Sudan, with ceasefires repeatedly breaking down in 2024 and
unsuccessful attempts at mediation by Qatar, Turkey and the UK, among others.
Under former president Joe Biden, the US sent special envoy Tom Perriello to
the region.</p><p class="MsoNormal">On Saturday, the rebel RSF, which controls roughly 40 per
cent of Sudanese territory, entrenched its position by declaring itself a
parallel government. The SAF government force this year retook the capital,
Khartoum, which it had abandoned early in the war, but it still remains based
in the alternative capital of Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Experts said the RSF's move to declare itself a parallel
government, which cements a de facto partition of the country, signalled its
determination not to be sidelined from the peace process. It also potentially
gave the RSF more leverage over the flow of aid, both to areas it controls and
to contiguous SAF-run regions, they said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some analysts suggested that the RSF, which the Biden
administration accused of genocide in Darfur in the west of the country, might
also now find it easier to purchase more advanced military hardware, including
fighter jets. The RSF is backed by the United Arab Emirates, according to
several UN reports and on-the-ground accounts, though the Emiratis have denied
supporting either side in the conflict.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ahmed Soliman, a Horn of Africa expert at Chatham House,
said the RSF was attempting to assert its authority over areas it controlled
and to bolster its national legitimacy as the representative of regions
including Darfur and parts of Kordofan. He said: "The key problem with
this is that it will be impossible to convince most Sudanese that the RSF and
its administration stand for the voices of the marginalised, given the heinous
and widespread atrocities they are responsible for."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kholood Khair, director of Confluence Advisory, a think-tank
formerly based in Khartoum, said the planned summit was important because it
was the "first mediation under Trump". However, she added that the
administration had sacked most of its experienced Sudan analysts, leaving it
with a lack of people who understood the roots of the crisis.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Given Trump's "transactional approach" towards
peacekeeping, Khair said she worried about a hastily concocted military and
economic carve-up that shut out Sudanese stakeholders, particularly the
grassroots civilian movement. "The plane is being built while it's in the
air," she said of the mediation process.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There were dozens of militia fighting in Sudan in addition
to the two main forces, Khair added, meaning that, even if Washington could
persuade the SAF and the RSF to make peace, "that would not necessarily
lead to an end of the war". It was even conceivable that other militias
could declare themselves a government in certain regions, she said, further
fragmenting a country that had already split into two with the creation of
South Sudan in 2011.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Â </p></body></html>
