tariffs on imports from India and also impose an unspecified penalty, as he hit
out at the South Asian nation’s trade policy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US president yesterday posted online that Indian tariffs
were “among the highest in the world,” adding New Delhi had “the most strenuous
and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.” India had “always
bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia” and was
Moscow’s biggest purchaser of energy at a time when the Ukraine war was still
raging, Trump said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!” he wrote. “INDIA WILL THEREFORE BE
PAYING A TARIFF OF 25%, PLUS A PENALTY FOR THE ABOVE, STARTING ON AUGUST
FIRST.” In a separate post he added: “WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH
INDIA!!!”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US president had said on Tuesday he would be imposing
sanctions on Russia, including “secondary tariffs” on its energy customers, if
Moscow did not halt the war in Ukraine within 10 days.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump has also been pushing countries to boost purchases of
US energy and military equipment. The EU said it would buy more American
weapons as part of a trade deal with the US struck over the weekend.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Indian government said it had “taken note” of Trump’s
statement and was “studying its implications.” It added that it remained
committed to “concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral
trade agreement,” but attached “the utmost importance” to protecting and
promoting the welfare of farmers, entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized
businesses. “The government will take all steps necessary to secure our
national interest,” it said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trump’s announcement follows three turbulent weeks in which
he has alternated between issuing letters threatening high tariffs on other
countries and announcing deals. The tariffs on New Delhi would, if implemented,
probably affect Apple’s plan to source more than 60mn iPhones sold each year in
the US from India by the end of 2025.</p><p class="MsoNormal">With shipments from China declining, India accounted for 44
per cent of smartphones imported to the US in the second quarter of this year,
up from 13 per cent in the same period in 2024, according to research group
Canalys.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Dhiraj Nim, a Mumbai-based economist at ANZ, said the 25 per
cent tariffs almost took India back to the 26 per cent levy Trump announced on
his so-called liberation day on April 2, adding: “Some of India’s Asian peers
have clinched a deal with a more favourable tariff rate.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">India has been among dozens of countries forced into
bruising trade negotiations with the Trump administration.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Although trade talks between the two nations appear to have
stalled... we believe the trade saga is far from over,” said Madhavi Arora,
chief economist at Emkay Global in Mumbai.</p><p class="MsoNormal">During weeks of intense talks between US and Indian
negotiators, a deal sometimes appeared imminent, with Trump telling reporters
this month it was “very close” to being completed.</p></body></html>
