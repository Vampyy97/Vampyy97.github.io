artistic risks, and should take them. But where do you draw the line between
bold concepts and bad ideas?</p><p class="MsoNormal">Schoenberg's monodrama <i>Erwartung</i> has to be
paired with something; it's only half an hour long. "Der Abschied"
("The Farewell"), the final song in Mahler's <i>Das Lied von der
Erde</i>, is a concert work, but why not? Toss in Webern's <i>Five Pieces
for Orchestra</i> as a six-minute bridging passage, and you get Salzburg
Festival's <i>One Morning Turns into an Eternity</i>, a glorified concert
programme. Throw a lot of money at it. Hope for the best.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, choosing busy big-name artists is not a
recipe for success. Director Peter Sellars appears to have poured his heart
into the penning of a turgid synopsis and then abandoned ship. George Tsypin's
sets look like the kind of inoffensive kinetic art you might find in the atrium
of an upmarket shopping mall. And the lighting recalls a high school disco.
Red! Now blue! Let's try a spotlight before plunging everything into darkness!
Did they even rehearse?</p><p class="MsoNormal">"A woman is looking for the body of a man whom she is
almost certain is no longer alive. She has reason to believe he has died under
torture. They are both part of a resistance movement," writes Sellars in
the programme book. This is not the story of <i>Erwartung</i>, but it is
also not what we see. Instead, the staging opens with two men in military
overalls dumping a body bag in front of the woman. Sellars cannot even follow
his own plot summary.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"The man's death will be denied by the state. His life,
his courage, his honour and tenderness have already been erased." Really?
All we see is a woman gesticulating with silent-movie exaggeration, trying with
every fibre of her being to fill the cavernous stage of the Felsenreitschule.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Fortunately, the woman is Ausrine Stundyte, and she is a
powerful enough performer to command attention even without the semaphore. The
same goes for Fleur Barron, who sings the Mahler beautifully, despite
everything.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Luckily, the Vienna Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonen's
direction eclipses the amateur theatrics above. This orchestra lives and
breathes this repertoire, bringing the deep romanticism of Schoenberg and the
bleak darkness of Mahler onto the same page of Viennese expressionism. Salonen
never lapses into pathos, keeps the whole under taut control, tells it all like
a thriller.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>One Morning Turns into an Eternity</i> is a musical
triumph with an utterly superfluous staging, a lavish concert with an operatic
price tag. Peter Sellars has been coasting on his reputation for long enough.
It is time to pass on the jobs to people with genuinely new ideas.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To August 18, salzburgerfestspiele.at</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
