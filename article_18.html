"data labellers" in Africa and Asia with highly paid industry
specialists, in the latest push to build "smarter" and more powerful
models.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Companies such as Scale AI, Turing and Toloka are hiring
experts in fields such as biology and finance to help AI groups create more
sophisticated training data that is crucial for developing the next generation
of AI systems.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The rise of so-called "reasoning" models, such as
OpenAI's 03 and Google's Gemini 2.5, has accelerated the move away from
employing thousands of low-cost workers in countries such as Kenya and the
Philippines, who are typically paid less than $2 an hour to undertake the
time-consuming task of annotating the huge datasets used to train AI models.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"The AI industry was for a long time heavily focused on
the models and compute, and data has always been an overseen part of AI,"
said Olga Megorskaya, chief executive and co-founder of Dutch group Toloka.
"Finally, [the industry] is accepting the importance of the data for
training."</p><p class="MsoNormal">This shift has led to a surge in investor interest in
data-labelling start-ups. In June, Meta invested $15bn in the US group Scale
AI, doubling its valuation to $29bn, as part of a push to catch up with rivals.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In March, California-based Turing AI raised $111mn at a
$2.2bn valuation, while Jeff Bezos's personal firm Bezos Expeditions led a
$72mn investment round for Toloka in May.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Previously, data labellers would handle simple tasks, such
as drawing boxes on images to identify objects, describing what images
represent, selecting fluent ways to express things and weeding out bad answers
from datasets that often contained violent or graphic content.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Because AI models need more data to perform better, these
workers were expected to process tasks in seconds and complete hundreds of
tasks during a working day to create vast datasets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Now, the demand for these tasks had dropped significantly as
many of them could be automated, said Megorskaya.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Joan Kinyua, president of the Data Labelers Association in
Kenya, said workers were now being tasked with jobs that relied on localised
language skills and knowledge. The group had also seen jobs in which human
labellers were tasked with conducting final quality control checks for
AI-generated content.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As leading AI groups such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Google
attempt to develop models that they claim will exceed human intelligence, there
is a push to focus on the quality of datasets and hiring experts to examine
complex problems.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"What these models now need is data of a real human
using the models to do knowledge work, and getting feedback on when the model
is failing," said Jonathan Siddharth, co-founder and chief executive of
Turing AI.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To ensure that models perform well in a wide variety of
fields, from coding to physics and finance, deep-pocketed AI companies are now
willing to pay for more sophisticated datasets and experts from around the
world.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To attract people from different industries, Turing paid
experts 20-30 per cent more than they received in their current jobs, said
Siddharth. While budgets for data are only about 10-15 per cent of the hundreds
of billions of dollars AI companies spend on computing power, it remained an
"enormous amount of money," he added.</p><p class="MsoNormal">New features and capabilities, such as chain of thought,
which shows how AI models solve problems step by step, were developed by having
human experts show how they broke down problems, said Toloka's Megorskaya.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Experienced software engineers might also be asked to come
up with tasks that are relevant for their field, and then solve them by writing
code, debugging it and checking for security vulnerabilities.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, validating a physics theory would require
contributions from a physicist to articulate how to build a simulator to test
whether the theory is true, a software engineer to code the simulator and a
data scientist to analyse the results of the simulation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"The result of this is the model's not just going to be
better than a physicist. It's going to be better than a superposition of
somebody who's at the top in physics, computer science and data science,"
said Turing's Siddharth.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
