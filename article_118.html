scandal</h2><p class="MsoNormal">MONICA MARK — JOHANNESBURG</p><p class="MsoNormal">Bain &amp; Co is to shut its consultancy business in South
Africa, where it has struggled to shake off the “stigma” of its role in a
corruption scandal that brought down a former president.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Alongside McKinsey and KPMG, Bain suffered reputational
damage from its involvement in a “state capture” scandal under the presidency
of Jacob Zuma, during which key state agencies were hollowed out by graft and
stripped of financial assets.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In 2022, the Zondo commission investigating widespread
corruption in South Africa’s government found that Bain had colluded in “one of
the few instances where President Zuma was himself directly and personally
involved in the activities and plans to take over a government entity”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Zuma stepped down in 2018 after years of scandals and
allegations of corruption, which he denied.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a statement, Bain confirmed it was winding down its
consulting operations in South Africa. It said its Johannesburg office would
become “a services hub supporting Bain’s global operations, retaining the vast
majority of our talented local employees.” Services hubs at professional
services firms generally provide back-office functions and do not sell advice
directly to clients.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The difficulties created by the Boston-headquartered firm’s
work in South Africa had contributed to the decision to close down in the
country, said a person familiar with the matter. “They already found it
difficult to work in the public sector, but increasingly there was a headwind
they were facing even with private sector clients and in the recruitment and
retention of talent,” the person said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“There was a stigma associated with their past, which they
weren't able to satisfactorily address. They decided after some time that it
was just too hard — they weren't going to be able to re-establish themselves as
a management consultancy group of integrity.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">South Africa’s National Treasury in September 2022 barred
Bain from doing business with the state for 10 years, a ban the firm moved to
fight in court.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Bain had been brought in by the Zuma government in 2015 to
restructure the South African Revenue Services, or SARS, although the tax
collection agency was already considered world-class at home and abroad.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Over three years, the agency became a shadow of its former
self, eventually struggling to carry out basic services including tax
collection, and providing housing and electricity.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The consultancy group in 2018 admitted that its work for the
tax agency fell short of its standards, and refunded all the fees and interest
that it had earned from its work for SARS.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Stephen York, managing partner of Bain’s South Africa
business, said previously that the consultancy regretted playing any role in
damaging the tax agency, but maintained that it had been the victim of a “false
narrative” and that it had never knowingly conspired in state capture.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We are ashamed of what happened at SARS, but we would like
to get back to the work of helping the South African economy grow,” York said
in 2022.</p></body></html>
