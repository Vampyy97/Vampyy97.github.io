in boost to bloc</h2><p class="MsoNormal">Alice Hancock — Brussels</p><p class="MsoNormal">Google has said it will sign the EU’s code of practice for
artificial intelligence, in a boost to the bloc as it tries to hold firm on its
digital rules in the face of heavy pressure from the US government and other
Big Tech groups.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The code sets out guidance for how general purpose AI should
comply with the EU’s landmark AI Act, which includes legal obligations for the
safe use of AI, copyright protections for creators and transparency around the
models used to train AI.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Kent Walker, president of global affairs and chief legal
officer at Google's parent company Alphabet, said yesterday that the company
would sign “with the hope that this code, as applied, will promote European
citizens’ and businesses’ access to secure, first-rate AI tools as they become
available”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But, he added, the internet giant would also submit
feedback, because the AI Act and the code “risk slowing Europe's development
and deployment of AI”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Departures from EU copyright law, steps that slow
approvals, or requirements that expose trade secrets, could chill European
model development and deployment, harming Europe’s competitiveness,” Walker
warned.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The EU's AI Act is considered the world’s strictest regime
for regulating the fast-developing technology. It has been heavily criticised
by the US government and Big Tech groups, which argue that it will stifle
growth.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a statement on the EU-US trade deal signed by European
Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and US President Donald Trump on
Sunday, the White House said that the two economies “intend to address
unjustified digital trade barriers”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However, the EU has said that its online rules are a red
line and will not be changed. “We are not moving on our right to regulate
autonomously in the digital space,” a commission spokesperson said on Tuesday.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Google joins OpenAI and the French artificial intelligence
company Mistral in signing the code, which applies to powerful AI models such
as Google’s Gemini, Meta’s Llama and OpenAI’s GPT-4.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Microsoft president Brad Smith told Reuters earlier this
month that it was “likely” that Microsoft would sign the code.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Facebook owner Meta remains one of the few major AI
developers to refuse to sign the code. Joel Kaplan, its chief legal officer,
said in a statement earlier this month that it “introduces a number of legal
uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the
scope of the AI Act”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Meta’s refusal to sign follows an open letter from the chief
executives of large European companies, including Airbus and BNP Paribas,
urging a two-year pause by Brussels and warning that unclear and overlapping
regulations were threatening the bloc’s competitiveness in the global AI race.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The AI Act is set to come into force early next month.</p></body></html>
