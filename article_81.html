inauguration, Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, told the incoming
president that the US would achieve human-level artificial general intelligence
during his term in office. Altman has framed this achievement as part of an
existential AI race between the US and China. The desire to win this contest
explains numerous US government actions — from the Biden administration’s
export controls on China to the $500bn “Stargate” data centre project to the action
plan that Trump released last week to accelerate AI development.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Both countries are investing heavily in the technology. But,
outwardly at least, they appear to be pursuing different goals. While US
leaders prioritise developing the most intelligent models possible, Chinese
policymakers are most focused on AI’s widespread application.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To use Silicon Valley parlance, the Chinese Communist Party
seems far less “AGI-pilled” than their American counterparts. Although leading
Chinese labs like DeepSeek, Zhipu, and Stepfun state their ambitions to reach
AI that can equal the abilities of the human mind, top Chinese government
officials barely address AGI.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For one, the Chinese government lacks an official term that
captures what Altman and others mean when they say AGI. The term used in China
is <i>tongyong rengong zhineng</i>, the precise translation of which is
“general-purpose AI”. This suggests a system applied to many uses rather than
human-level intelligence.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nor is the Chinese government taking obvious steps to create
the physical infrastructure necessary for AGI. It has been slow to build the
“superclusters” of computing chips that US hyperscalers are constructing.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Instead, Xi Jinping has emphasised applying AI to practical
purposes. He has consistently said that China’s AI sector should be “strongly
oriented toward applications.” From industrial robotics to products like Manus,
a leading AI agent, this is already becoming a reality.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Xi has, however, openly embraced the goal to “catch up and
surpass” the US in science and technology, including in AI.</p><p class="MsoNormal">So why not AGI?</p><p class="MsoNormal">One explanation is that US export controls have seriously
inhibited China's ability to obtain vast amounts of computing power needed for
future AI models. Another possibility is that Chinese officials may see AGI as
an abstract construct and not imminent, preferring to focus on more tangible
goals. If Silicon Valley is wrong and human-level AI remains out of reach then
China’s focus on applications will look prescient.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There is, however, a third possible and more worrying
explanation for China’s approach: the perennially secretive CCP might be
concealing its interest in AGI. This would not be a new phenomenon: China has
engaged in the largest nuclear weapons build-up since the Cold War, but it does
not publicly acknowledge the scale of this expansion. The CCP might fear
stronger US policy responses if it were to openly declare its interest in AGI.</p><p class="MsoNormal">What this means is that even if the US and China are running
what look like different races in AI, direct competition remains intense.
Whether Xi doubts AGI, feels constrained, or is concealing his intentions,
there is a profound risk on both sides of “technological surprise” — when a
rival gains an unexpected technological capability, it can escalate the risk of
conflict.</p><p class="MsoNormal">If Altman’s timeline is right and the US rapidly attains
human-level AGI to Beijing’s surprise, then China might fear the irretrievable
loss of strategic competition. It may act to reclaim it using multiple levers
of power — including offensive cyber operations, coercion, diplomatic pressure,
and even military force.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Alternatively, if China’s leaders are hiding their AGI
efforts then the US could be on the receiving end of an ugly shock and take its
own actions to redress the balance.</p><p class="MsoNormal">These scenarios drive home a key strategic insight: in
isolation, both the intensification of US-China rivalry and the explosion of AI
breakthroughs are world-changing. Together, their simultaneity and
interconnectedness create unprecedented risk.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Policymakers around the world are ill-prepared to manage
these combined strategic and technological developments. Many struggle to stay
up to date with AI developments, let alone plan for the geopolitical
ramifications of new breakthroughs. But they must prepare — now to mitigate
these risks. The coming years will be far more dangerous than many of the
technology’s investors and policymakers realise.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b> </b></p></body></html>
