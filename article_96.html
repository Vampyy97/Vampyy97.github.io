widespread starvation and disease, the UN-backed global food security body has
said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The warning came as the World Food Programme said Israeli
restrictions continued to stop the UN moving enough food to avoid
"catastrophic human suffering" among the strip's 2mn people.</p><p class="MsoNormal">One in three children in Gaza City, the enclave's largest
population centre, was acutely malnourished, reaching the threshold for famine,
said the UN-backed panel, called the Integrated Food Security Phase
Classification.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Images of malnourished children and the bodies of starved
babies in the besieged strip have shocked observers in recent days, including
US President Donald Trump, who said on Monday that there was "real
starvation" in Gaza and "we have to get the kids fed".</p><p class="MsoNormal">That came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Sunday said there was "no starvation" in Gaza.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The food security panel is analysing data before deciding
whether to declare Gaza as in the grip of a full-blown famine but, in the
interim, said it was releasing this "stark warning today that the
worst-case scenario of famine is now unfolding in the Gaza Strip". The WFP
said that Israeli promises to create humanitarian corridors - pauses in the
fighting during which aid agencies could drive trucks after co-ordinating with
the Israeli military had yet to yield "the permission to move in the
volumes that we've requested".</p><p class="MsoNormal">Gaza needs a vast influx of humanitarian aid, transported
rapidly across the enclave, to stave off full-blown famine, aid agencies have
said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"Waiting for official confirmation of famine to provide
life-saving food aid they desperately need is unconscionable," said Cindy
McCain, WFP executive director. "We need to flood Gaza with large-scale
food aid, immediately and without obstruction, and keep it flowing each and
every day to prevent mass starvation."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Israel had blocked any food from entering Gaza for almost 80
days after it ended a ceasefire in mid-March. It subsequently championed a
US-backed, militarised initiative called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation,
whose rollout has been marred by the killings of almost 1,000 people by Israeli
troops guarding its four distribution sites.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The food security panel said analysis of the GHF "food
packages shows that their distribution plan would lead to mass starvation, even
if it was able to function without the appalling levels of violence that have
been reported".</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Israeli siege, the limited amount of aid the military
has allowed in and the difficulty moving that food around the enclave has meant
Gazans are now the hungriest they have been since the conflict was triggered by
Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7 2023.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nine in 10 families regularly report having no food, being
forced to scavenge in rubbish or take extreme risks to find anything to feed
their children, the UN panel said. Prices for staples, when available, have
shot up as much as 5,600 per cent, it said, leaving even those with financial
resources unable to eat.</p><p class="MsoNormal">After Trump's remarks, Netanyahu said Israel would create
humanitarian corridors and pause fighting each day to allow convoys through.
Humanitarian agencies report little improvement.</p></body></html>
