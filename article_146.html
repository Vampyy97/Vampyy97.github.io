Xi summit’</p><p class="MsoNormal">By Demetri Sevastopulo — Washington<br/>
Kathrin Hille — Taipei</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US cancelled a meeting with Taiwan's defence minister in
June, deepening concerns in Taipei that President Donald Trump is wary of
supporting the country in ways that could anger China.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Wellington Koo had planned to visit the Washington area for
defence talks with Elbridge Colby, the number three official at the Pentagon.
But the US called off the meeting at the last minute, according to several
people familiar with the matter.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US told Taiwan the timing was bad because of its strikes
on Iran. But several of the people said there were other concerns. Some US
officials worried that allowing the Taiwanese defence minister’s visit would
undermine US-China trade negotiations and damage Trump’s efforts to secure a
summit with President Xi Jinping.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US and Taiwan are discussing new dates. But people
familiar with the matter said the US wanted to hold the meeting at a lower
level than Koo, which has amplified concerns that Trump wants to avoid
antagonising China. One US official said it was still unclear at what level
they would be held.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The cancellation came after a call between Trump and Xi,
sparking speculation the US president may have caved in to Chinese pressure.
Letting Koo visit would have signalled a willingness to ignore pressure from
China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan. Under unwritten rules, the US has
not allowed Taiwan's defence minister to visit the Washington area because the
countries have not had official relations since Washington switched diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Taiwan's de facto embassy in Washington said it was
“long-standing policy... not to comment on matters related to military
exchanges". The White House declined to comment. The Pentagon has been
approached for comment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The cancellation comes at a tough time for Taiwan’s
President Lai Ching-te. The FT reported on Monday that the White House had
denied Lai permission to visit New York en route to Central America after the
Chinese embassy in the US raised concerns.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In Taiwan, an activist bid at the weekend to recall more
than half the opposition Kuomintang’s contingent in parliament failed to unseat
a single lawmaker.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The US decision to cancel the meeting “will further hurt his
standing at home, on the heels of a major political defeat that has shaken the
unity of Lai’s party and emboldened his opposition”, said Amanda Hsiao at
Eurasia Group.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ryan Hass at the Brookings Institution said postponing Lai’s
transit came “against a backdrop of growing unease in Taipei about a perception
that President Trump is seeking to lower tensions with Beijing to smooth a path
towards his expected meeting with Xi this fall”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Taipei, responding to strong US prodding, has sought to step
up arms procurement to become more capable of defending itself against
invasion. Last month, Taiwan started the process of applying for US permission
to buy $20bn of American munitions and weapons, according to three people
familiar with the situation. Taipei plans for those sales to go ahead next
year. But that timeline could be jeopardised by US efforts to avoid disrupting
trade talks or high-level meetings with China.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Evan Medeiros, a China expert at Georgetown University, said
cancelling the defence meeting “weakens deterrence of China, it unnerves Taiwan
leaders and it undermines resolve at home”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Washington Post first reported the cancelled defence
meeting.</p></body></html>
