did not expect any more concessions on Donald Trump’s car tariffs as the trade
war eroded profits and sales across the European car industry.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Carmakers have been reeling from Trump's trade policies,
with EU vehicle exports to the US subject to additional 25 per cent tariffs,
before a deal between the two sides was agreed on Sunday. Following the deal,
that tariff rate is expected to fall from 27.5 per cent, which includes an
existing 2.5 per cent tariff, to 15 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While the industry has welcomed the EU-US trade deal, German
carmakers led by BMW and Mercedes-Benz have lobbied for months for a separate
mechanism that would allow manufacturers to offset import tariffs if they also
export vehicles from the US.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“That global deal for now is it,” Mercedes-Benz chief
executive Ola Kallenius said, acknowledging that the Trump administration was
now unlikely to grant those concessions.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Last week, Volkswagen boss Oliver Blume also said he would
pursue a separate agreement to cut tariffs below 15 per cent by highlighting
promises for “huge investments in the US”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Mercedes-Benz was among groups seeking US concessions beyond
those agreed by the EU.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But yesterday, Blume, who doubles as CEO of Porsche,
reversed his position and said a separate deal was unlikely following his
discussions with US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“We don't consider this to be just a storm that is passing
by,” Blume said. “The world has changed dramatically.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The comments came after Mercedes-Benz said it was expecting
the adjusted return on the sales margin at its car division to be between 4 and
6 per cent in 2025, including the impact of US tariffs. That compared with a
previously forecast range of 6 to 8 per cent, which was withdrawn in April due
to uncertainty over tariffs.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For the three months to the end of June, the Stuttgart-based
company reported that its adjusted operating profit halved from a year earlier
to €2bn, in line with analyst expectations. Revenue fell 9.8 per cent to €33bn
as sales in China continued to decline.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Porsche said it now expected its return on sales margins at
5 to 7 per cent following a €400mn hit from US tariffs. It had previously
forecast a range of between 6.5 and 8.5 per cent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Second-quarter operating profits fell 91 per cent year on
year on the back of restructuring and tariff costs and a drop in deliveries in
China and Europe</p></body></html>
