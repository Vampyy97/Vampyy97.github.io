with a deluge of paperwork as the Trump administration expands audits of their
employment authorisations in its push to deport undocumented migrants.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While the media are focused on images of masked Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents storming farms, factories and construction
sites to arrest foreign nationals, executives are more worried about ICE's
growing scrutiny of the forms they file to demonstrate that their staff are
authorised to work in the US, called “I-9”.</p><p class="MsoNormal">More than a dozen human resources leaders, global mobility
professionals and their immigration attorneys told the Financial Times that
they are stuck in “I-9 hell” as they race to identify and fix errors on the
forms before receiving a dreaded Notice of Inspection.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Employers under audit are given three days to hand over I-9
forms and supporting documents for all current employees. Errors as small as
forgetting to tick a box can result in fines that start at $2,861 per violation
and often stretch into the millions, plus criminal charges for executives. In
April, ICE said it fined three Denver businesses more than $8mn for employing
unauthorised workers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Last month, the general manager of a San Diego
powder-coating business was sentenced to one year of probation after pleading
guilty to hiring undocumented immigrants without authorisation to work, the
justice department said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“I said it couldn't get worse,” said John Mazzeo, associate
general counsel at job applicant screening provider Vertical Screen. “It
happened to get worse.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">The panic among employers has reached a fever pitch since
May, when ICE said that its agents visited several Washington DC restaurants to
initiate audits in person. The notices are traditionally sent via mail or
email.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Trump administration is “working with American employers
to ensure they have the legal workforce they need to be successful,” White
House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said, adding that recent worksite raids had
“rescued migrant children” from a marijuana facility and resulted in the arrest
of a paedophile.</p><p class="MsoNormal">People familiar with the agency’s thinking said that while
deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records remained the priority,
auditing employers had emerged as a cost-effective way for agents to identify
potential targets for removal.</p><p class="MsoNormal">ICE does not regularly publish data on the number of audits
it is conducting, leaving employers to rely on their personal networks for
information on the crackdown.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Shaun Staller, a business immigration partner at law firm
Obermayer, said that he had “certainly” seen a substantial increase in audits
since Donald Trump took office in January.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Audits also surged during Trump’s previous term, jumping 374
per cent between the end of the Obama administration in 2017 and 2019.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“There was talk in Trump one but nothing like this,” said
Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute who studies
worksite enforcement. “This is completely different in scale.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lawyers said that ICE initially seemed to be targeting
small, service sector businesses in big cities, but that its net was expanding.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The growing worry in the human resources industry is what
prompted one Atlanta-based executive to initiate an audit of her technology
start-up’s I-9 records for its 700 employees.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Our audit revealed many people with expired [Employment
Authorisation Documents], so we had to let them go,” said the executive, who
requested their name be withheld because they feared retribution from their
employer. “It’s I-9 hell.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Employers complain that simply preparing for an ICE
inspection is costly, as it typically involves hiring outside counsel and can
result in needing to replace workers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Vertical Screen has had its “best year ever” as employers
jostle for help with getting their paperwork in order, Mazzeo said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Since 1986, US employers have been responsible for verifying
that anyone they hire is legally allowed to work in the country. But the
complexity of the form itself means that “it’s very common for employers not to
have [complete] records,” Staller said.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The four-page I-9 form is so technical that US Citizenship
and Immigration Services publishes an eight-page manual on how to complete it.
Employees can present more than 50 combinations of documents to prove their
identity and employment authorisation, according to an analysis by the American
Immigration Lawyers Association.</p><p class="MsoNormal">HR executives also complain that the Trump administration
added a new layer of complexity to the process with its efforts to roll back
Biden-era programmes that extended legal status to migrants from unstable
countries, meaning that documents submitted by hundreds of thousands of workers
from Haiti are suddenly invalid.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“I would be shocked to hear of any company of size, you know
1,000 people, where they do not at least have to have a conversation with
someone about a fake document,” said Mazzeo, who is also a former ICE attorney.</p><p class="MsoNormal">“It’s just so prevalent, especially with the scrutiny [ICE]
is now giving it.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p></body></html>
